"""The structured changeset describing *what* changed in a model mutation, as opposed to the bare
:class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchangeobserver.ModelChangeType` marker. A modifier (e.g. AMR)
populates one from the delta it already computes; :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.recordChange`
records it, bumping ``model.topology.version``.

A pull-based consumer instead compares its own last-seen version against ``model.topology.version``
at its own next tick and, on a mismatch, reconciles from ``model.topology.changesSince(lastSeenVersion)`` --
a single :class:`ModelChange`, coalesced across every mutation it missed. Cheap ``touches...()``
queries let it early-out when the change doesn't concern it, and ``parentToChildren``/``faceMap``
let it patch only what changed instead of rebuilding from scratch.

def _composeSubstitutions(maps: list) -> dict:

    The net map is, by definition, the pairwise fold: map ``k`` is merged into the net map of maps
    ``0 .. k-1`` by replacing every value item that map ``k`` has as a key with map ``k``'s value
    for it (an item it doesn't have stays itself), and by then appending map ``k``'s keys that are
    not keys already, in map ``k``'s order. Folding like that re-walks every list accumulated so far
    for every new map -- quadratic in the history, 368 s for the 372 changes of a long AMR run.

    Here every item is resolved exactly once instead. An item that appears in the value of map
    ``k`` is only ever substituted by maps ``k+1, k+2, ...``: by the *first* later map that has it
    as a key, whose value items are in turn resolved by the maps after *that* one. So, walking the
    maps from the newest to the oldest, the fully resolved value of every key of map ``k`` is the
    concatenation of the already resolved values its items have at their next occurrence as a key
    (or the item itself, if no later map has it). The cost is linear in the size of the result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    maps

        a key of a later map.
