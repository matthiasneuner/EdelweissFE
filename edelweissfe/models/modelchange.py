"""The structured changeset describing *what* changed in a model mutation, as opposed to the bare
:class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchangeobserver.ModelChangeType` marker. A modifier (e.g. AMR)
populates one from the delta it already computes; :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.notifyModelChanged`
records it (bumping ``model.topologyVersion``) and passes it to any registered push observers.

A pull-based consumer instead compares its own last-seen version against ``model.topologyVersion``
at its own next tick and, on a mismatch, reconciles from ``model.changesSince(lastSeenVersion)`` --
a single :class:`ModelChange`, coalesced across every mutation it missed. Cheap ``touches...()``
queries let it early-out when the change doesn't concern it, and ``parentToChildren``/``faceMap``
let it patch only what changed instead of rebuilding from scratch.
