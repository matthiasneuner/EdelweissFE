class TopologyPipeline:
    """Everything about changing the mesh of a :class:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel`
    during a run, held by the model as ``model.topology``.

    The model itself is the mesh and its data. This class is the machinery around changing it:

    - the **topology window** (:meth:`changes`), the only scope in which elements and nodes
      may be created or removed;
    - the **number allocators** (:meth:`reserveElementNumbers`, :meth:`reserveNodeNumbers`), which
      make numbering a pure function of the creation order;
    - the **fixed-point rounds** (:meth:`update`), in which every model modifier (e.g. AMR)
      plans and applies until none has anything left to do;
    - the **change log** (:attr:`version`, :meth:`changesSince`) and the registry of
      **mesh dependents** (:meth:`refreshMeshDependents`), from which ties and contact catch up;
    - the **history** of every applied decision, its **fingerprint**, and the **replay** of that
      history on restart (:meth:`replayHistory`).

        Not cheap: it walks the whole mesh, measured at 0.188 s on 64k elements / 69k nodes. A live
        run pays it once per *applied* modifier decision, in :meth:`recordChange`. A replay
        pays it once for the whole history (:meth:`replayHistory` carries the recorded
        digests forward and checks the final one), unless ``verifyFingerprintsPerRecord``
        asks for the per-record walk to locate a divergence.

        Uses blake2b rather than :func:`hash`, whose string hashing is randomised per process and
        would make the digest differ between two runs of the *same* code.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            A 32-character hex digest.

        """Register everything an applied decision produced: the replay record and the changeset.

        Two things are recorded here, deliberately in one place:

        * an entry in :attr:`history`, holding the plan in the modifier's own serializable
          form plus the resulting topology fingerprint -- which is what lets a resumed run be
          checked round by round instead of only at the end;
        * the ``modelChange`` itself, stamped with the next :attr:`version`, so :meth:`changesSince`
          and :meth:`refreshMeshDependents` can see it.

        A model modifier therefore reports what it did in exactly one way: by returning a
        :class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` from
        :meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.apply` -- there
        is no second channel to keep in sync, and so no way to update one and forget the other.

        Both callers of ``apply`` (the live :meth:`update` loop and
        :meth:`replayHistory`) route through here, so a replayed run records the same
        changesets in the same order as the run it replays.

        Cost is one :meth:`fingerprint` per *applied* decision -- not per iteration, but not
        free either: 0.188 s measured on 64k elements / 69k nodes -- unless the caller supplies the
        fingerprint, which a replay does (see :meth:`replayHistory`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        time
            Model time to stamp the record with. Defaults to the current :attr:`time`; a replay
            passes the recorded time instead, so a resumed run's history carries the times the
            decisions were originally made rather than the time it was resumed at.
        fingerprint
            The digest to record. Defaults to :meth:`fingerprint` of the model as it is
            now, which is what a live run wants. A replay passes the digest the original run
            recorded, so the replayed history carries the digests that were verified rather than
            fresh ones that would launder a divergence into the next checkpoint.

        This is the whole point of the plan/apply split: the modifier's :meth:`apply` runs here
        exactly as it did live, fed a decoded plan instead of a freshly evaluated one. There is no
        replay-specific code path to drift from the live one -- which is what the previous design
        had, and why a resumed run silently renumbered its elements.

        What a replay does *not* repeat per record is the whole-mesh work around ``apply`` whose
        result is a pure function of the final mesh: the :meth:`fingerprint` walk (the
        recorded digests are carried forward and the final one is checked) and the node-field
        bookkeeping (deferred to the end of the window, see :meth:`changes`). A history of
        a few hundred refinements on a mesh of tens of thousands of elements replayed in minutes
        otherwise, all of it spent re-deriving state that the next record, or :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.readRestart`,

            and the error names the first diverging one -- so a divergence is located rather than
            merely detected.
