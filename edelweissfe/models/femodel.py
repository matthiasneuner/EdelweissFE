        Two things are recorded here, deliberately in one place:

        * an entry in :attr:`topologyHistory`, holding the plan in the modifier's own serializable
          form plus the resulting topology fingerprint -- which is what lets a resumed run be
          checked round by round instead of only at the end;
        * the ``modelChange`` itself, via :meth:`notifyModelChanged`, so :meth:`changesSince` and
          :meth:`refreshMeshDependents` can see it.

        A model modifier therefore reports what it did in exactly one way: by returning a
        :class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` from
        :meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.apply`. It must
        not call :meth:`notifyModelChanged` itself -- there is no second channel to keep in sync,
        and so no way to update one and forget the other.

        Both callers of ``apply`` (the live :meth:`updateTopology` loop and
        :meth:`replayTopologyHistory`) route through here, so a replayed run records the same
        changesets in the same order as the run it replays.

        Cost is one :meth:`topologyFingerprint` per *applied* decision -- not per iteration, but not
        free either: 0.188 s measured on 64k elements / 69k nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time
            Model time to stamp the record with. Defaults to the current :attr:`time`; a replay
            passes the recorded time instead, so a resumed run's history carries the times the
            decisions were originally made rather than the time it was resumed at.
