    """Drive one entry of a material's property vector along a prescribed function of time.

    The constructor is typed: it takes the material itself and the property function as a callable.
    Resolving ``material=myMaterial`` against the model and compiling ``f(t)='1000 - 500 * t'`` into
    that callable is the job of :meth:`fromStepActionDefinition`, which is the only part of this
    module the ``.inp`` front-end needs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of this step action.
    material
        The material whose property is changed, as the model holds it: a
        ``{"name", "properties"}`` record for the Marmot material provider, or a material instance
        for the edelweiss material provider.
    index
        The zero-based index of the property in the material's property vector.
    f_t
        The value of the property as a function of time. Required and positional, unlike the optional
        ``f_t`` amplitude of the other step actions, because driving the property along it is this
        action's entire purpose -- there is no meaningful default.

        Note that ``f_t`` is evaluated at the **absolute step time**, not at the step progress in
        ``[0...1]`` as everywhere else: it yields the property value itself rather than a factor
        scaling one. That asymmetry is intentional, and is why the input file's ``f(t)`` for this
        keyword means something different than for e.g. ``>>dirichlet``.
    model
        The model tree. Accepted for uniformity with the other step actions; the sections carrying
        this material are looked up in the model handed to :meth:`applyAtIncrementStart`.
    journal
        The journal object for logging.
