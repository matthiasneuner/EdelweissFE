class StepActionBase(OptionSchemaProvider, ABC):
    """This is the base class for all step actions.
    User defined step actions must implement the methods.

    Two construction paths (see ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md``, P3(c))
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    A step action is reached either from Python or from an ``.inp`` file, and the input file is a
    *serialization* of the Python path, not a second way of building the object. So a **ported**
    step action declares a real typed constructor -- ``nSet`` is a node set, ``f_t`` is a callable,
    prescribed values are a ``dict`` -- and overrides :meth:`fromStepActionDefinition` /
    :meth:`updateStepActionFromDefinition` to translate the parser's option mapping into a call to
    it. Everything string-shaped stays on that translation, which is the only thing the ``.inp``
    front-end adds.

    An **unported** step action needs no changes at all: the two hooks below default to the legacy
    convention of handing the raw ``definition`` dict to ``__init__``/``updateStepAction``, so the
    port proceeds one module at a time. Which path a module takes is decided by whether it overrides
    the hooks -- ordinary polymorphism, not attribute probing, and no list of ported modules for
    anyone to forget to update.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of this step action.
    definition
        A dictionary containing the options for this step action.
    jobInfo
        A dictionary containing the information about the job.
    model
        The model tree.
    fieldOutputController
        The field output controlling object.
    journal
        The journal object for logging.

        This is the L4 seam: the one place a module's input-file shape (numbered component options,
