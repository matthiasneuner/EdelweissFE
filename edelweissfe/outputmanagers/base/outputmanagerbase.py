    """This is the abstract base class for all output managers.
    User defined output managers must implement the abstract methods.

    Deriving from :class:`~edelweissfe.utils.schema.OptionSchemaProvider` means every output
    manager -- including one supplied by a third-party package via an entry point -- exposes a
    ``schema`` class attribute, so the L3 registry can hand its L2 option schema to the caller
    alongside the class itself. Subclasses that have not been ported to L1/L2 yet simply inherit
    the default of ``None``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of this output manager.
    definitionLines
        The dictionary containing the definition of the output manager.
    model
        A dictionary containing the model tree.
    fieldOutputController
        The field output contoller instance.
    journal
        The journal instance for logging.
    plotter
        The plotter instance for plotting.

        The counterpart, on the output manager side, of the name-based ``>>options`` override
        mechanism (``stepactions/options.py``): once that mechanism has resolved an ``>>options,
        name=X, ...`` block to this output manager instance and validated the present keys against
        ``type(self).schema`` via :func:`~edelweissfe.utils.schema.coercePresentOptions`, it calls
        this method with the result to actually apply them.

        Concrete output managers vary in how (or whether) they store overridable runtime options --
        unlike a solver's uniform ``self.options`` dict, there is no single shared storage shape to
        update generically here, so the default is a no-op and a subclass overrides it with its own
        named fields (ordinary polymorphism, not attribute probing -- see :class:`OutputManager` in
        ``ensight.py`` for the one concrete case that needs this today).

        Parameters
