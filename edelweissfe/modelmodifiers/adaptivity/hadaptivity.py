#: The node-field value entries carried across a refinement by isoparametric interpolation from the
#: parent element. ``"U"`` is the solution and is always present. ``"V"`` (velocity) and ``"A"``
#: (acceleration) are the kinematic state of a dynamic solver -- and they *have* to be carried,
#: because unlike a quasi-static solver, which reconstructs everything it needs from ``"U"``, a time
#: integrator holds state that nothing else can reproduce: a new node whose velocity defaulted to
#: zero would silently lose it. Interpolating them with the same operator as ``"U"`` is also what
#: keeps them consistent with it -- the shape functions are a partition of unity, so a uniform
#: velocity field is reproduced exactly and the patch's momentum is conserved exactly in that case
#: (the general case differs at second order in the velocity gradient across the parent, which is
#: discretisation error, not a defect).
#:
#: ``"A"`` is carried for the same reason, with one qualification the implicit dynamic solver acts
#: on: an interpolated acceleration is not in equilibrium with the operators that are reassembled on
#: the refined mesh, so that solver re-solves it from equilibrium on the next increment (see
#: :mod:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitdynamic`). The interpolation is still what that solve
#: starts from, and what a solver that switches the re-solve off keeps.
#:
#: Carrying an entry a given run never writes is free: the entries exist (zero) on every
#: mass-carrying node field from job setup on, and interpolating zeros yields zeros -- so a static
#: or explicit run is unaffected by ``"A"`` being listed here.
#:
#: An entry absent from a given node field is skipped, so this list is safe to extend.
