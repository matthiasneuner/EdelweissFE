"""Regenerates contact/tie facet elements after the mesh underneath them changes.

Facet generation *is* a topology change -- it creates and deletes elements -- so it belongs in the
topology-update phase, alongside the modifiers whose refinements it reacts to. It used to hang off
the consumers instead: a tie regenerated its own facets from inside its reconcile. That made every
tie and contact a mutating consumer, which is what forced the old push-notification path and its
re-entrancy (a consumer minting elements while a modifier was still inside its own loop). With this
modifier owning the work, constraints become pure readers of ``model.elementSets[...]``.

The modifier is implicit: it is created automatically once any ``*surface`` facet recipe has been
registered (see :func:`~edelweissfe.generators.surfaceelementgenerator.buildContactFacets`), and is
ordered last so it reacts to whatever the primary modifiers did in the same round. Users do not
declare it -- they already declared the recipe.
