"""Analytical-surface node snapping for AMR-refined curved boundaries (HEX20 only).

A coarse mesh represents a curved boundary (e.g. a borehole) as a polygon of flat facets. When
AMR h-refines elements attached to that boundary, the new nodes it creates do NOT improve
geometric fidelity toward the true curve -- ``Hex20Topology.subdivide`` evaluates the PARENT
element's own (possibly already-flat) isoparametric map, so a straight parent edge only ever
produces more straight sub-edges. This purely reactive model modifier reacts to an AMR
modifier's :class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` and snaps exactly the newly
created nodes on a tracked boundary onto a specified analytical surface (currently: a cylinder),
leaving every pre-existing node untouched.

See the ``surfaceSnap`` section of :doc:`/documentation/modelmodifiers` for the full narrative
(corner/midside modes, hanging-node and quality-safeguard behaviour, restart safety) and a runnable
example.

**Restart safety.** Which element faces are "on the tracked surface", and which candidate nodes
are still waiting to be snapped, is decision-side state that must survive a checkpoint/resume
exactly like hAdaptivity's own tracked node sets do: by living in two genuine
:class:`~edelweissfe.sets.nodeset.NodeSet` instances (:attr:`ModelModifier._wallSetName` and
:attr:`ModelModifier._pendingSetName`, both private to this modifier instance) that a restart
rebuilds by REPLAYING this modifier's own recorded :class:`SnapPlan` history -- the same
mechanism, not a parallel one. This is why :meth:`ModelModifier.apply` grows/shrinks those node
sets independent of whether any node's coordinates actually moved this round: a round can
legitimately snap nothing (every candidate is a hanging-node collision, or the quality safeguard
vetoed all of them) while still discovering real new wall-face membership -- or resolving an
earlier round's pending one -- that matters later. Touching either tracked set marks
:class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` non-empty (via ``changedNodeSets``) even when
``movedNodes`` is empty, so that round is always recorded and always replays -- no state is ever
silently lost across a restart.

**Retrying what a round could not snap.** A candidate that could not be snapped this round --
because it was an AMR hanging-node slave, or because snapping it (or a sibling on the same round)
would have dropped an affected element's quality below ``qualityDropThreshold`` -- is not
abandoned: it stays in the pending set and is reconsidered on every later round that changes
anything, since either condition can resolve (a hanging slave stops being one once its coarse
neighbour is itself refined; a quality veto can clear once local geometry changes).
