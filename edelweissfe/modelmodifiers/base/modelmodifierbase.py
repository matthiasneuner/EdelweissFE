        True means a solver that runs the topology update exactly once, before its increment loop, is
        enough for this modifier; False means the update has to be re-run as the solution evolves. The
        distinction exists because those are genuinely different capabilities: re-running the update
        mid-analysis invalidates everything derived from the mesh, which an implicit solver rebuilds
        from its node fields but an explicit one cannot, its velocity state being solver-local. See
        :meth:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearexplicitdynamic.NED.validateModelCapabilities`.

        of re-deciding from state that may not be identical.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            The FEModel object. Read only -- do not mutate it here.
        change
            The net :class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` since this modifier last

            pipeline reach a fixed point instead of looping (see

        step

            The current timeStep.

        **Must not read solution state.** A pure function of ``(model, plan)`` -- everything the
        decision depended on belongs in the plan. This is the single code path shared by a live run
        and a restart replay, and the reason a replayed mesh is numbered identically: there is no
        second implementation to drift apart from this one.

        Runs inside an open topology window (see

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            The FEModel object, mutated in place.
        plan
            A plan previously returned by :meth:`plan` (live) or restored from the recorded
            topology history (replay).

        about reconstructing the model, so getting it wrong cannot corrupt the mesh.

        ----------
        records

    # getRestartData/setRestartData are gone. A modifier no longer serializes its own history, nor
    # implements its own replay: FEModel records every applied plan in model.topology.history and
    # replays it through this class's apply(). The previous arrangement had each modifier
    # reimplementing the mutation for the replay path, which is precisely why a resumed run could
    # rebuild a differently-numbered mesh -- two implementations of one mutation always drift.
    # Decision-side state that plan() needs goes through restoreDecisionState() instead.
