        changing it.

        This half is allowed to read solution state: markers, node fields, the current time, the
        step. It must return a **serializable** description of the decision, which
        :meth:`apply` can carry out on its own, or ``None`` if there is nothing to do.

        A restart replay never calls this. It reads the recorded plan and calls :meth:`apply`
        directly, which is what makes a resumed run reproduce the original topology exactly instead
        of re-deciding from state that may not be identical.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            The FEModel object. Read only -- do not mutate it here.
        change
            The net :class:`~edelweissfe.models.modelchange.ModelChange` since this modifier last
            planned within the current topology update, or ``None`` on the first round. **Return
            ``None`` when it does not touch this modifier's domain** -- that is what lets the
            pipeline reach a fixed point instead of looping (see
            :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.updateTopology`).
        step
            The current step.
        timeStep
            The current timeStep.

        Returns
        -------
        object | None
            A plan for :meth:`apply`, or ``None``.

        **Must not read solution state.** A pure function of ``(model, plan)`` -- everything the
        decision depended on belongs in the plan. This is the single code path shared by a live run
        and a restart replay, and the reason a replayed mesh is numbered identically: there is no
        second implementation to drift apart from this one.

        Runs inside an open topology window (see

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            The FEModel object, mutated in place.
        plan
            A plan previously returned by :meth:`plan` (live) or restored from the recorded
            topology history (replay).

        holding a stale reference, which later corrupts element-set membership and can surface as a
        node that is simultaneously Dirichlet-prescribed and a multi-point-constraint slave.

        :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.checkModelModifierDomains` compares these

        depends only on the model and the solution state, both of which the restart restores anyway.
        Deliberately separate from :meth:`apply`: this is about how the *next* decision is made, not
        about reconstructing the model, so getting it wrong cannot corrupt the mesh.

        Parameters
        ----------
        records

    # getRestartData/setRestartData are gone. A modifier no longer serializes its own history, nor
    # implements its own replay: FEModel records every applied plan in model.topologyHistory and
    # replays it through this class's apply(). The previous arrangement had each modifier
    # reimplementing the mutation for the replay path, which is precisely why a resumed run could
    # rebuild a differently-numbered mesh -- two implementations of one mutation always drift.
    # Decision-side state that plan() needs goes through restoreDecisionState() instead.
