"""A field-split block-AMG linear solver for large coupled multi-field systems.

Why this exists
---------------

On the large coupled fracture models (displacement + gradient-enhanced damage, penalty contact,
adaptive refinement), a direct factorization dominates the run and -- more importantly -- hits a
memory wall past ~1M dof, because its fill-in grows superlinearly. Algebraic multigrid has O(n)
memory and is the route to those sizes, but applied *monolithically* to the coupled system it is
ineffective: a single AMG hierarchy cannot represent the disparate physics and scales of the fields
at once -- measured directly on a real coupled system, a monolithic hierarchy's residual reduction
plateaus around 0.2 rather than converging, regardless of how the near null-space is chosen; the
missing ingredient is the field-block structure itself, not a better single hierarchy.

The remedy, following Alkmim et al. (IJNME 2026), is a *block* preconditioner: an AMG hierarchy per
field, combined by a block Gauss-Seidel sweep, used to precondition an outer GMRES over the full
coupled system. Each field's operator (elasticity for a displacement field, a Helmholtz-like operator
for a damage field) is individually AMG-friendly even though their monolithic coupling is not.

The field structure -- which DOFs belong to which field, and each field's nodal dimension -- is not
carried by the matrix; it is pushed in from the DofManager by the nonlinear solver (via
:class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.base.LinearSolver`), so nothing about the block layout
has to be specified by hand.

What it does per solve
----------------------

#. **Equilibrate.** Symmetric diagonal (Jacobi) scaling :math:`\\hat A = D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}` removes
   the large dynamic range (Dirichlet penalties + stiffness) that otherwise wrecks AMG's
   strength-of-connection. The solve is done on :math:`\\hat A` and unscaled at the end.
#. **Split** :math:`\\hat A` into the field diagonal blocks and their couplings, from the field ranges.
#. **Build one AMG hierarchy per field** (AMGCL, built once per solve via ``build`` and applied many
   times via ``applyPreconditioner`` -- the pattern churns between Newton iterations, so the hierarchy
   cannot be reused *across* solves, but it is reused across the outer GMRES iterations *within* a
   solve). A vector field (nodal dimension > 1, e.g. displacement) is given its full rigid-body
   near-null-space -- 3 translations plus 3 infinitesimal rotations, the standard basis for 3D
   elasticity AMG, since both are directions in which the discretized operator has essentially zero
   stiffness -- when node coordinates are available, translations alone otherwise; a scalar field
   takes the default constant.
#. **Precondition GMRES** with a block Gauss-Seidel sweep over the fields, each field's correction
   coming from one AMG V-cycle on its block, the couplings folded in between fields.

This is a *feasibility-grade* solver: on the reference model AMGCL's smoothed aggregation converges
but not tightly on the (non-symmetric, contact + tie condensed) displacement block, so the outer
GMRES needs O(100) iterations. That is acceptable where the point is to fit in memory at sizes a
direct solver cannot reach; the iteration count would likely come down further with a
nonsymmetric-aware AMG library (e.g. Trilinos/MueLu) built specifically to precondition
non-symmetric operators, at the cost of an additional heavy external dependency -- AMGCL's own
symmetric-aggregation-based hierarchy already reaches a working feasibility point without one.

#
# backendPrecision defaults to "double": measured on all 9 dumped ords of a real reference model,
# "float" inflated outer GMRES iterations by up to 30% and only won on wall-clock about half the

# single-precision backend should in principle buy -- plausibly because the Chebyshev smoother's own
# power-iteration spectral-radius estimate is itself sensitive to reduced precision, losing accuracy
# in float32 in a way that degrades smoother quality enough to eat most of the bandwidth saving.
#
# backendBlockSize defaults to 1 (scalar): kept opt-in via fieldPreconds, not the default, since a
# block-valued backend has not been validated to win inside this block-Gauss-Seidel preconditioner
# (a faster standalone solver is not automatically a better single-cycle preconditioner component). A
# vector field of nodal dimension d maps to backendBlockSize: d (3 for a 3D displacement field, 2 for
# a 2D one). Setting it > 1 skips set_nullspace (see __call__) -- AMGCL's near-null-space path is
# unimplemented for block value types.

# power_iters=300 (was 50): AMGCL's Chebyshev smoother estimates the operator's spectral radius via
# power iteration whose start vector is seeded per-OpenMP-thread by thread id
# (amgcl/backend/builtin.hpp) -- deterministic for a given thread count, but a different vector at a
# different thread count (a parallel power iteration typically partitions the random starting vector
# across worker threads, so the number of independent per-thread random streams -- and hence the
# effective starting vector -- changes with thread count even though the operator itself does not).
# The estimate itself (and hence the smoother's damping quality) was therefore thread-count dependent.
# At 50 iterations the estimate can be badly under-converged on a hard operator at some thread counts
# (measured: 1460 vs 43 outer iterations, same matrix, only OMP_NUM_THREADS differing, on a solve
# where the true spectral radius -- verified independently via ARPACK -- barely moves between Newton
# iterations). 300 iterations converge the estimate close enough that it stops depending on thread
# count; measured 2.68x faster in aggregate on 10 captured degraded systems at production's real 16
# threads (811s -> 302s), with no observed downside on systems that were already fine.

class BlockAMGSolver(LinearSolver):
    """Field-split block-AMG preconditioned GMRES. Callable as ``(A, b) -> x``.

    The block structure is not configured here -- it is derived by the base class from the model and
    DOF manager the nonlinear solver hands over via
    :meth:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.base.LinearSolver.setModel`. A field's near null-space is decided
    from its nodal dimension: a vector field (dimension > 1) gets its full rigid-body basis
    (translations and rotations) when node coordinates are available, translations alone otherwise;
    a scalar field takes the default constant.

    Stateful across calls in two independent ways (both driven by ``||b||`` alone -- this solver, like
    :mod:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.inexactnewton.inexactnewton`, sees only ``(A, b)`` per call and
    reconstructs Newton-loop state from residual jumps rather than being told about them):

    #. **Adaptive outer tolerance** (Eisenstat--Walker forcing, "choice 2"), the default. Most Newton
       iterates do not need the linear solve tight, and loosening the requested tolerance for them cuts
       outer iterations substantially without changing the Newton path -- provided GMRES's own
       *preconditioned*-residual stopping check is not allowed to silently let the *true* residual run
       looser than the requested ``eta`` (a real risk with an imperfect preconditioner, see the
       true-residual enforcement below); once that gap is closed, adaptive forcing reproduces the exact
       same Newton trajectory as a tight fixed tolerance, just faster. Pass ``outerTol=<a float>`` to
       pin a fixed tolerance instead if a specific model needs that guarantee.
    #. **Per-field AMG hierarchy reuse across Newton iterations**, on by default. Building a hierarchy
       is a large, avoidable fraction of a solve when the Jacobian has moved only a little since the
       last one. The outer GMRES always operates on the current, fresh matrix; only the block
       preconditioner ``M`` may be stale, so the *converged solution* is unaffected regardless of ``M``
       -- a stale ``M`` only costs a few extra outer iterations at the *same* requested tolerance, so
       (unlike (a)) it cannot by itself change the Newton path. Refreshed on a residual jump (new
       increment / cutback), on a field-structure change (e.g. AMR), on any sparsity-pattern change
       (a model with contact and/or tie constraints typically churns its sparsity pattern on every
       single Newton iteration as the active contact/tie set evolves, so in practice this keeps the
       hierarchy fresh every call on such a model -- a safe no-op there, not a win; a model without
       that churn may see a real one), or when the previous solve's outer count grew past
       ``hierarchyStalenessFactor`` times the one before it.

    Every solve also enforces the requested tolerance on the *true* (unpreconditioned) residual, not
    just GMRES's own preconditioned stopping check -- see ``trueResidualMaxContinuations``. GMRES's
    convergence test here is on the preconditioned residual (``callback_type="pr_norm"``), which can be
    considerably smaller than the true one under an imperfect preconditioner (this one, by design), so
    "converged" could otherwise mean a true residual well above ``eta`` (measured on a real reference
    model: a 1.6e-2 true residual when 1e-4 was requested).

    Parameters
    ----------
    outerTol
        A fixed outer GMRES relative tolerance, overriding Eisenstat--Walker forcing. ``None`` (the
        default) uses adaptive forcing instead -- see ``etaMin``/``etaMax`` below.
    outerRestart, outerMaxiter
        The outer GMRES restart length and maximum restart cycles.
    outerSolver
        ``"amgcl_lgmres"`` (default) uses AMGCL's own native ``amgcl::solver::lgmres`` at both
        outer-solve call sites (the main solve and the true-residual continuation retry below) -- see
        ``edelweissfe/linsolve/amgcl/amgcl-wrapper.hpp``'s ``LGMRESOuterSolverT`` for why: SciPy's own
        GMRES orchestration (Arnoldi/Gram-Schmidt/restart bookkeeping, all run from Python) was found
        to be the single largest unaddressed cost bucket on the outer loop of a real reference model
        (roughly 38% of solve wall-clock). Live-gated at multiple thread counts: trajectory-identical
        to the SciPy default, no NaN (once ``lgmresAlwaysReset`` -- see below -- was fixed), and
        increasingly faster than SciPy as thread count grows -- SciPy's own orchestration anti-scales
        past one NUMA node on multi-socket hardware, AMGCL's native implementation does not. ``"scipy"``
        uses ``scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres`` instead, kept as a fallback/opt-out, not removed.
    lgmresM, lgmresK, lgmresAlwaysReset
        Only used when ``outerSolver == "amgcl_lgmres"``: forwarded to AMGCL's own ``lgmres::params``
        fields ``M`` (inner iterations per outer restart, default ``30``), ``K`` (recycled/augmented
        vectors carried between restarts, default ``3``), and ``always_reset`` (default ``True`` here,
        matching AMGCL's own upstream default). ``always_reset=False`` keeps the recycled Krylov
        vectors alive *across* separate outer solves, on the theory that a hard solve's converged
        subspace is a useful warm start for the next one; measured on real dumped systems this
        contributed *nothing* (bit-identical iteration counts whether reset or not), and on a real live
        run it was actively *harmful* -- a solve that already struggled (125 outer iterations, flagged
        as "possible preconditioner degradation") left a poorly-conditioned recycled subspace that,
        left unreset, compounded into a subsequent solve needing 428 iterations (vs. 159 with
        ``always_reset=True``) and, in the original live run, an outright NaN. There is no evidence
        recycling ever helps here, and clear evidence it can hurt badly -- so this now defaults to
        AMGCL's own choice of resetting every solve.
    lgmresResetOnNewIncrement
        Only used when ``outerSolver == "amgcl_lgmres"``. When ``True``, the recycled Krylov vectors are
        discarded (one-shot, via the ``resetOnce`` parameter to ``PyAMGCLLGMRESSolver.solve``) exactly on
        a solve where ``newIncrement`` is detected -- i.e. at an increment/cutback boundary, never on a
        true-residual continuation retry of the same solve -- and kept alive across every other call. A
        candidate middle ground between always resetting and never resetting, for a model where
        within-increment recycling might help even though cross-increment recycling (see
        ``lgmresAlwaysReset`` above) measurably does not. Default ``False``: unvalidated, so this
        leaves ``lgmres``'s behaviour identical to always-resetting unless explicitly turned on.
    sweeps
        Block Gauss-Seidel sweeps per preconditioner application.
    symmetric
        If True, each sweep is followed by a reverse-order sweep (symmetric block Gauss-Seidel).
    fieldPreconds
        Optional mapping of field name to an AMGCL preconditioner parameter tree, overriding the
        dimension-based default for that field.
    useRigidBodyNullspace
        ``True`` (the default) builds a vector field's near null-space as the full rigid-body basis --
        translations *and* rotations -- once nodal coordinates for that field are available via
        ``self._model`` (set by :meth:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.base.LinearSolver.setModel`), instead of
        translations alone. The rotations matter because, for 3D elasticity, they are (like the
        translations) directions in which the discretized operator has essentially zero stiffness, so
        smoothed aggregation needs them in its near-null-space basis to represent that error class
        exactly on the coarse levels -- without them, that class of error has nowhere efficient to go,
        since a Chebyshev smoother is (by its own spectral-window construction) not targeting
        near-zero-eigenvalue error either. Measured ~28-31% fewer isolated per-field outer iterations on
        two real captured systems, robust to both thread count and the Chebyshev ``power_iters``
        setting, unlike translations-only, which is sensitive to both. Falls back to translations-only
        automatically for any field whose coordinates are unavailable (e.g. an offline probe that only
        ever calls the lower-level ``setFieldStructure``, with no model to read coordinates from) --
        never a hard requirement. Set ``False`` to force translations-only unconditionally.
    p1Maps
        Optional mapping of field name to a ``(isCorner, edgeEndpoints)`` P1 topology map
        (:func:`edelweissfe.numerics.p1topology.buildP1Map`), injected directly. A vector field named
        here gets a :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.ptwogrid.PTwoGridPreconditioner` (an
        opt-in, experimental two-grid variant -- see the module docstring of
        :mod:`edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.ptwogrid`) instead of the single-level AMGCL default -- the
        map's presence *is* the opt-in, matching ``fieldPreconds``'s own by-presence convention. This
        is the offline-probe construction path (the map is known before the solver exists); for a live
        run built from a ``linsolverConfigFile``, use ``p1FieldNames`` instead -- the actual topology is
        computed lazily, once, the first time one of those fields' hierarchies is built (from
        ``self._model``, set by ``setModel``, rather than pushed in by the nonlinear solver ahead of
        time).
    p1FieldNames
        Optional list of vector field names to use p-multigrid for. A field named here gets its P1
        topology map computed on first need (via :func:`edelweissfe.numerics.p1topology.buildP1Map` on
        ``self._model``) and cached for this instance's lifetime. Ignored for a field also present in
        ``p1Maps`` (that field's map is already known; nothing to compute).
    etaMin, etaMax
        Clamp on the Eisenstat--Walker forcing tolerance (ignored if ``outerTol`` is given). ``etaMax``
        is also the tolerance used whenever there is no residual history to base a ratio on (the first
        solve, or the one right after a detected new increment/cutback).
    ewGamma, ewAlpha
        The Eisenstat--Walker "choice 2" parameters: ``eta_k = gamma * (||b_k|| / ||b_{k-1}||) **
        alpha``. Defaults ``gamma = 0.9``, ``alpha = (1 + sqrt 5) / 2`` are the classic values.
    residualGrowthFactor
        A solve whose ``||b||`` exceeds this multiple of the previous solve's ``||b||`` is treated as
        the first solve of a new increment (or a cutback): the forcing tolerance resets to ``etaMax``
        and the AMG hierarchies are refreshed rather than reused.
    hierarchyStalenessFactor
        Refresh the AMG hierarchies before the *next* solve if this solve's outer GMRES count exceeded
        this factor times the previous solve's -- a growing count is the signal that the reused
        hierarchies are drifting away from the current Jacobian.
    trueResidualMaxContinuations
        How many times to warm-restart GMRES (``x0`` from the previous attempt, same ``As``/``bs``/``M``
        /``eta``) if the true relative residual still exceeds ``eta`` after GMRES itself reports
        convergence. ``0`` disables this and restores the original preconditioned-residual-only
        behaviour.
    verbosity
        One of ``"silent"``, ``"warning"`` (default), ``"info"``, ``"debug"``. Messages go through the
        injected Journal (:meth:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.base.LinearSolver.setJournal`), falling back to
        ``print`` if none was set. ``"warning"`` emits nothing on a normal solve and only speaks up on
        an abnormal one: outer iterations past ``warnOuterIterationsThreshold``, the true-residual
        tolerance still unmet after every continuation, or GMRES itself reporting non-convergence.
        ``"info"`` adds one compact line per solve; ``"debug"`` adds one line per true-residual
        continuation attempt too. Per-stage wall-clock (equilibration, off-diagonal split, hierarchy
        build, outer GMRES, continuations) is recorded via
        :mod:`edelweissfe.utils.performancetiming` regardless of verbosity, nested under "linear solve"
        in the job's own performance table.
    warnOuterIterationsThreshold
        A solve needing more outer GMRES iterations than this triggers a ``"warning"``-level message
        (a preconditioner-quality red flag), even when ``verbosity="silent"`` is not set to suppress it.
    dumpOnDegradationDir
        If set, write the raw ``(A, b)`` of every solve whose outer-iteration count exceeds
        ``dumpOnDegradationThreshold`` to this directory (created if missing), for offline diagnosis
        of *why* the preconditioner degraded -- unlike
        :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.matrixdump.matrixdump.MatrixDumpSolver`, which dumps by a
        fixed ordinal decided *before* the solve runs, this decides by the solve's own outcome, so it
        is the mechanism for capturing pathological systems (e.g. a late-increment, heavily damaged
        Jacobian) without knowing in advance which solve ordinal that will be. ``None`` (the default)
        disables this entirely -- it costs nothing when off. Dumped alongside each ``(A, b)`` pair is
        the field-block layout (name, DOF range, nodal dimension) active for that solve, needed to
        replay it through this same block preconditioner offline without a live model.
    dumpOnDegradationThreshold
        The outer-iteration count above which a solve's system is dumped. ``None`` (the default) reuses
        ``warnOuterIterationsThreshold``, so a dump and its corresponding warning message fire on
        exactly the same solves.
    dumpOnDegradationMaxDumps
        A process-wide ceiling on the number of degradation dumps written (across every
        ``BlockAMGSolver`` instance in this process, e.g. one per analysis step) -- a disk-space guard
        in the same spirit as :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.matrixdump.matrixdump.MatrixDumpSolver`'s
        ``maxDumps``, since a run that degrades badly could otherwise trigger the condition on every
        remaining solve. Counts every individual ``(A, b)`` pair written, including the ones
        ``dumpOnDegradationContextSolves`` adds -- a trigger with a full context window can spend
        several units of this budget at once.
    dumpOnDegradationContextSolves
        How many of the solves immediately *preceding* a degraded one to also dump (``0``, the
        default, dumps only the triggering solve itself, matching the original behaviour). A single
        ``(A, b)`` snapshot cannot distinguish "this operator is intrinsically hard" from "this
        solve's own state -- a reused, now-stale AMG hierarchy, or (with ``lgmresAlwaysReset=False``)
        a carried-over Krylov subspace -- degraded independently of the operator", because both look
        identical from the matrix alone; a naive offline diagnosis can be fooled by exactly this --
        a fresh solver instance replaying the dumped matrix alone can converge in a fraction of the
        live iteration count if the live degradation was actually state, not the operator. Capturing
        the preceding sequence lets an offline replay feed a *persistent*
        solver instance the same solves in the same order, reproducing whatever cross-solve state the
        live run had at the triggering solve, instead of only ever seeing what a cold start would do.
        Every dumped solve (trigger or context) also records ``mustRefresh``/``patternChanged``/
        ``newIncrement``/``previousOuterIters`` in the manifest, so the hierarchy-staleness question
        can often be answered directly from the manifest without needing a replay at all.
