"""Near-null-space construction for one vector field's diagonal block, for AMGCL's smoothed-
aggregation coarsening inside :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.blockamg.BlockAMGSolver` (§25/§26).

Split out of ``blockamg.py`` into its own module (matching ``ptwogrid.py``'s precedent for other
blockamg auxiliary pieces): both functions here are pure geometry/linear-algebra with no
``BlockAMGSolver``-instance state, just a field's block layout, its diagonal-equilibration scaling,
and (for the richer basis) its node coordinates.

:func:`rigidBodyNullspace` (translations *and* rotations) is the one actually used whenever node
coordinates are available -- measured ~28-31% fewer isolated per-field outer iterations than
:func:`translationNullspace` alone on two real captured production systems, and unlike translations
alone, robust to both thread count and the Chebyshev ``power_iters`` setting. Building it costs one
extra pass over the field's own diagonal block's diagonal-scaling vector plus a handful of elementwise
array operations on the node coordinates -- O(nNodes), negligible next to the AMG hierarchy build it
feeds into; :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.blockamg.BlockAMGSolver` still times it (nested
under "blockamg: hierarchy build") so that assumption is verified on every run, not just asserted here.
