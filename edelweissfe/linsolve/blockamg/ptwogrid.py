"""p-multigrid (Galerkin P1 corner-node) preconditioner for one field's diagonal block inside
:class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.blockamg.BlockAMGSolver`'s per-field sweep.

Precondition the quadratic serendipity operator through a low-order P1 operator: :math:`\\nu`
Chebyshev sweeps on the field's own (equilibrated) block, restrict the residual through :math:`P^T`,
one AMGCL V-cycle on the Galerkin-projected :math:`A_1 = P^T A P`, prolong through :math:`P`,
:math:`\\nu` more Chebyshev sweeps. :func:`build` and :meth:`PTwoGridPreconditioner.applyPreconditioner`
match :class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.amgcl.amgcl.PyAMGCLSolver`'s ``build``/``applyPreconditioner``
call shape closely enough to slot into the same per-field sweep, so
:class:`~edelweissfe.linsolve.blockamg.blockamg.BlockAMGSolver` needs no change beyond choosing
which class to build (see ``blockamg.py``'s ``p1Maps`` option).

This is an **opt-in, experimental variant of the field-split AMG preconditioner**, not the shipped
default. The underlying two-grid algorithm converges (fewer outer GMRES iterations than the
single-level default is common), but it carries two structural costs the single-level default does
not: a fixed per-solve setup cost (the Galerkin projection ``P^T A P`` and the coarse hierarchy build
happen fresh every solve, since the operator's sparsity pattern generally changes every Newton
iteration on a model with contact/tie constraints, leaving nothing stable to cache), and a
near-null-space handling gap -- the coarse solve can be given the same rigid-body near-null-space
treatment the single-level default uses (restricted to the corner-node subset), but the fine-level
Chebyshev smoother, unlike a full recursive AMG hierarchy, has no coarsening step of its own and
receives no near-null-space information at all. Whether the iteration-count win outweighs these
costs is problem-dependent; it has been measured to lose to the single-level default overall on at
least one real reference model in the regime tested, so it should not be assumed to help without
checking on the model at hand.

**Dirichlet handling is load-bearing, do not simplify away.** A field's diagonal block still carries
its Dirichlet identity rows (production applies Dirichlet elimination upstream of blockamg). Both
the fine smoothing and the Galerkin projection must operate on the *free* submatrix with Dirichlet
rows/columns removed entirely, not merely masked in place -- masking in place for the fine smoother
alone was tried and diverged outright (17-80x residual growth). The mechanism is not a genuine
non-symmetry in the physical operator: a raw, Dirichlet-row-included diagonal block looks roughly
50% non-symmetric by a simple ``‖B-Bᵀ‖/‖B‖`` measure, but that figure collapses to ~0.6% once the
Dirichlet rows are properly removed (rather than merely zeroed) -- a storage artifact of how a
Dirichlet-eliminated row is represented in a sparse matrix, not physics. A free midside node whose
edge-endpoint corner is Dirichlet-constrained keeps only the surviving ½-weight on its free endpoint
-- no renormalization (the constrained corner contributes exactly zero to a homogeneous Newton
correction, which the dropped weight already encodes).

#: matches a higher-degree hierarchy's outer-iteration count almost exactly while cutting the coarse
#: apply's own cost by ~7% -- npre=1/npost=1 variants were cheaper per call but pushed outer GMRES
#: iterations up enough to be a wash or a regression (a weaker coarse correction is not free). A
#: direct PARDISO factorization of A1 was also tried and rejected: exact (residual ~1e-14) but no
#: cheaper per call (~70ms, matching this config) -- A1's ~71 nnz/row at 70k free coarse DOF fills in
#: heavily under a general (unsymmetric) LU, so an exact triangular solve costs about as much as the

#: power_iters=300 (was 50): the coarse solve uses the identical AMGCL Chebyshev relaxation code path
