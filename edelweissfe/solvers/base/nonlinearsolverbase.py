        the boundary condition takes precedence -- and report what was dropped.

        A DOF cannot be both eliminated by a constraint and prescribed. The alternative -- rejecting
        the model -- forces the user to subtract the constraint's slave nodes from the boundary
        condition's node set by hand, offline: a snapshot that goes stale the moment the mesh, the
        constraint tolerance or an adaptive refinement changes, and which additionally blocks the
        propagation of that boundary condition to nodes created later, since refinement extends a
        node set only where the whole parent face already lies within it. Resolving in favour of the
        boundary condition is what Abaqus does with the same conflict.

        Records are classified, not silently dropped:

        * **redundant** -- the constraint equation already delivers the prescribed value (every
          master with a non-negligible weight is itself prescribed, and the weighted sum matches).
          Dropping it changes nothing; reported quietly.
        * **overridden** -- it does not. Dropping it *does* change the model, so this is reported
          loudly with the worst offender: it usually means the boundary condition's node set is
          incomplete, or the constraint is not the one the user thought it was.

        Masters are resolved transitively first (a master may itself be a slave), exactly as the
        transformation does before it enforces anything.
