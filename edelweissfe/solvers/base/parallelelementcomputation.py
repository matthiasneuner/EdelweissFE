#: Single-entry cache of the per-chunk gather plan; see :func:`_chunkedGatherPlan`. One entry
#: suffices because a solver works on one element set at a time, and holding a reference to the

def _chunkedGatherPlan(elements: dict, entitiesInDofVector: dict, chunkSize: int) -> list:
    """Build, or reuse, the flat gather index plan for one chunking of the elements.

    Each chunk gets the concatenation of its elements' DOF indices, plus the offsets at which
    each element's slice begins, so a worker can gather the whole chunk with one fancy-index and
    then hand out views.

    The plan is only valid for the element set and DOF layout it was built from. h-adaptivity
    rebuilds the DofManager on every topology change, which produces a fresh
    ``idcsOfHigherOrderEntitiesInDofVector`` dict, so identity of that mapping is what detects a
    stale plan. The element count and chunk size are compared as well: those would catch a
    rebuild that somehow preserved the mapping object, and a stale plan here would silently
    gather the wrong degrees of freedom rather than fail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements
        The elements to compute, in the order they will be chunked.
    entitiesInDofVector
        The entity-to-DOF-index mapping the plan is built against.
    chunkSize
        Number of elements per chunk.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        One ``(chunkElements, flatIndices, offsets)`` tuple per chunk.
