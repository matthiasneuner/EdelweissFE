"""The nonlinear explicit dynamic solver.

An increment solves no equation system. Second-order fields are advanced by central differences
(a leapfrog, with the velocity staggered half an increment behind the displacement), first-order
fields -- a nonlocal damage field, for instance -- by forward Euler, and both divide by a **lumped**
mass, so the cost of an increment is one element pass plus vector arithmetic. There is no linear
solver, no Newton loop, and no cutback: the time increment is set by stability, not by convergence,
so a material that fails to integrate at the stable step is reported as an error rather than
answered with a smaller step.

The stable increment is computed once per mesh from the element wave speeds and scaled by
``courant-number``. It is recomputed whenever the mesh changes and deliberately *not* recomputed
when it has not: as a material softens the true limit only grows, so reusing it is the conservative
direction, and re-deriving it costs a full element pass.

**Three cadences, all in increments.** ``output-frequency`` is how often progress is logged and
field outputs are finalized (a divisor, so it must be at least 1). ``topology-check-frequency`` is
how often model modifiers may change the mesh mid-run, and must be a multiple of
``output-frequency`` because a marker reads the last finalized output; ``0`` runs the topology
update only once, before the increment loop. ``contact-update-frequency`` is how often constraints
whose connectivity is the outcome of a search re-run it; ``0`` disables that. The reasoning behind
the latter two, and what they cost in accuracy, is documented under
:doc:`/documentation/adaptivitytheory` and :doc:`/documentation/contacttheory` respectively.

**Constraints.** Multi-point constraints are enforced by folding a slave's mass and force onto its
masters (row-sum, mass-conserving) and slaving it kinematically, which leaves the critical time step
untouched. Other constraints -- contact above all -- are evaluated through
:meth:`~edelweissfe.constraints.base.constraintbase.ConstraintBase.applyConstraintExplicit`, which
asks for forces and no tangent, since a tangent assembled here would enter nothing. A constraint
that can act *only* through its tangent contributes nothing to an explicit increment and is
refused at validation rather than silently ignored.

**Energy balance.** Every reporting increment prints the external work accumulated at prescribed
degrees of freedom, the kinetic energy, the internal (strain) energy, and what remains unaccounted.
Its purpose is one check that nothing else performs: kinetic energy cannot exceed external work,
because the terms omitted from the balance are all non-negative, so a violation means energy is
appearing from nowhere and the time step is above the true stability limit -- which the critical
time step does not see in full, as it ignores the nonlocal field entirely and never sees contact
penalty stiffness.

Two honest limits, both of which the solver states in the log rather than leaving to be
discovered. The external work accumulates only at *prescribed* degrees of freedom, so a model
driven by body forces, node forces, a distributed load or an initial velocity has none, and the
check cannot fire; and the internal energy is whatever the materials publish as a strain energy,
which not every material does. When either is identically zero -- or the external work is
negative, a structure returning work at its boundary -- the balance is not usable as a
quasi-static criterion, and the honest substitute is to integrate a reaction force against its
prescribed displacement, both of which are available as ``saveHistory`` field outputs.

**Diagnostics across a topology change.** Because the lumped mass is the operator an increment
divides by, a refinement's effect on it is reported: total mass, per-component linear momentum and
kinetic energy before and after, plus the relative mass drift accumulated over every such change,
so that many individually-tolerable changes cannot silently add up to a meaningful one. The
smallest integrating mass in the model is reported alongside, since that is what bounds the step.

**Restart.** A resumed run must not repeat the half-step that starts a leapfrog: the velocity in
the checkpoint already carries the half-increment offset, so applying the startup again would apply
one half-impulse too few. The solver therefore takes the previous time increment from the restart
state rather than synthesising it, and the velocity field is checkpointed in its own right -- an
implicit solver reconstructs everything it needs from the displacement, a central-difference scheme
does not.

#: repartitioning a parent into children changes the quadrature truncation error. Measured

#: two legitimate sources of small violation: lumping the mass matrix, and the interpolate-then-
#: re-lump of a topology change, which does not conserve kinetic energy exactly (see
#: reportTopologyChangeConservation). One per cent is far above both and far below the runaway an
#: unstable time step produces -- v5 of the anchor pry-out reached 1e+38 mm.

        Refinement interpolates the velocity onto new nodes and re-lumps the mass, and the three
        invariants behave differently under that:

        * **Total mass is conserved exactly.** The children of a refined element tile it and carry the
          same density, so this is an identity rather than an approximation -- which makes it the
          cheapest correctness check on the entire transfer, and the one that catches a connectivity
          or geometry error nothing else would notice. Violating it raises.

          Restricted to the SECOND-ORDER field, which is the only one carrying mass in the physical
          sense. Summing the whole lumped vector also collects the first-order (nonlocal damage)
          field, whose "mass" is a viscosity: with eta_nl ~ 1e-4 against a density ~ 1e-9 that block
          outweighs the real mass by orders of magnitude, so a total-vector check is dominated by a
          quantity refinement need not conserve at all and would pass a 100 % error in the actual
          mass. The first-order block is reported separately rather than folded in.
        * **Linear momentum is conserved exactly for a spatially uniform velocity field**, because
          the shape functions are a partition of unity and the child masses sum to the parent's. For
          a general field the discrepancy is second order in the velocity gradient across the parent:
          discretisation error, not a defect. Reported, not enforced.
        * **Kinetic energy is not conserved** by interpolation plus re-lumping, and it is the most
          sensitive of the three, being quadratic in the interpolation error. Reported as a relative
          jump; more than roughly a percent is a reason to look at the transfer rather than to
          believe the physics.
