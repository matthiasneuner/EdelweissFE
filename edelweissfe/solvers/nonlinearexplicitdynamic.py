"""The nonlinear explicit dynamic solver.

An increment solves no equation system. Second-order fields are advanced by central differences
(a leapfrog, with the velocity staggered half an increment behind the displacement), first-order
fields -- a nonlocal damage field, for instance -- by forward Euler, and both divide by a **lumped**
mass, so the cost of an increment is one element pass plus vector arithmetic. There is no linear
solver, no Newton loop, and no cutback: the time increment is set by stability, not by convergence,
so a material that fails to integrate at the stable step is reported as an error rather than
answered with a smaller step.

**Inertia and damping.** An element reports two diagonals: the coefficient of each field's second
time derivative (its inertia) and of its first (its damping). The integrator divides by the one and
relaxes with the other, and *which* scheme a field gets is read off them -- an inertia means central
differences, a damping alone means forward Euler. The deck declares no field ordering, because an
inertia is exactly what a central-difference update divides by. At zero damping the update is
bit-identical to the undamped one.

The diagnostics need one thing more, and it is about units: which entries of the inertia diagonal
may be summed. That belongs to the FIELD rather than to a deck, and is recorded in
:mod:`edelweissfe.config.phenomena` as a mass, a rotational inertia, or neither. Linear momentum
sums the first kind, the energy balance the first two; conservation across a topology change is
checked per field regardless.

The case that forces it: a first-order field's forward-Euler limit falls off with the SQUARE of the
element size, so on a refined mesh it, not the mechanical field, bounds the increment. Giving it an
inertia makes it second order -- a damped wave equation, limit linear in h -- with its old
coefficient keeping its value and becoming the damping. Marmot supplies one through the ``nonlocal
micro inertia`` element property; that inertia is a time squared, so ``0.5 m_k rate^2`` is a volume
rather than an energy and the field is registered as carrying a non-mechanical inertia, which keeps
it out of both balances.

``first-order-fields``, ``second-order-fields``, ``first-order-scheme`` and ``second-order-scheme``
are removed rather than deprecated: a deck carrying any of them now fails with ``Invalid option``,
and deleting those lines is the whole of the migration.

The stable increment is computed once per mesh from the element wave speeds and scaled by
``courant-number``. It is recomputed whenever the mesh changes and deliberately *not* recomputed
when it has not: as a material softens the true limit only grows, so reusing it is the conservative
direction, and re-deriving it costs a full element pass.

**Three cadences, all in increments.** ``output-frequency`` is how often progress is logged and
field outputs are finalized (a divisor, so it must be at least 1). ``topology-check-frequency`` is
how often model modifiers may change the mesh mid-run, and must be a multiple of
``output-frequency`` because a marker reads the last finalized output; ``0`` runs the topology
update only once, before the increment loop. ``contact-update-frequency`` is how often constraints
whose connectivity is the outcome of a search re-run it; ``0`` disables that. The reasoning behind
the latter two, and what they cost in accuracy, is documented under
:doc:`/documentation/adaptivitytheory` and :doc:`/documentation/contacttheory` respectively.

**Constraints.** Multi-point constraints are enforced by folding a slave's mass and force onto its
masters (row-sum, mass-conserving) and slaving it kinematically, which leaves the critical time step
untouched. Other constraints -- contact above all -- are evaluated through
:meth:`~edelweissfe.constraints.base.constraintbase.ConstraintBase.applyConstraintExplicit`, which
asks for forces and no tangent, since a tangent assembled here would enter nothing. A constraint
that can act *only* through its tangent contributes nothing to an explicit increment and is
refused at validation rather than silently ignored.

**Energy balance.** Every reporting increment prints the external work accumulated at prescribed
degrees of freedom, the kinetic energy, the internal (strain) energy, and what remains unaccounted.
Its purpose is one check that nothing else performs: kinetic energy cannot exceed external work,
because the terms omitted from the balance are all non-negative, so a violation means energy is
appearing from nowhere and the time step is above the true stability limit -- which the critical
time step does not see in full, as it never sees contact penalty stiffness, and sees the nonlocal
field only where that field carries a non-mechanical inertia. Such a field's own
``0.5 m_k rate^2`` is reported on a separate line and kept out of the balance: with a coefficient in
seconds squared it has the units of a volume, not of an energy.

Two honest limits, both of which the solver states in the log rather than leaving to be
discovered. The external work accumulates only at *prescribed* degrees of freedom, so a model
driven by body forces, node forces, a distributed load or an initial velocity has none, and the
check cannot fire; and the internal energy is whatever the materials publish as a strain energy,
which not every material does. When either is identically zero -- or the external work is
negative, a structure returning work at its boundary -- the balance is not usable as a
quasi-static criterion, and the honest substitute is to integrate a reaction force against its
prescribed displacement, both of which are available as ``saveHistory`` field outputs.

**Diagnostics across a topology change.** Because the lumped mass is the operator an increment
divides by, a refinement's effect on it is reported: total mass, per-component linear momentum and
kinetic energy before and after, plus the relative mass drift accumulated over every such change,
so that many individually-tolerable changes cannot silently add up to a meaningful one. The
smallest coefficient the increment divides by is reported alongside -- an inertia at a
second-order degree of freedom, a damping at a first-order one -- since that is what bounds the
step.

**Restart.** A resumed run must not repeat the half-step that starts a leapfrog: the velocity in
the checkpoint already carries the half-increment offset, so applying the startup again would apply
one half-impulse too few. The solver therefore takes the previous time increment from the restart
state rather than synthesising it, and the velocity field is checkpointed in its own right -- an
implicit solver reconstructs everything it needs from the displacement, a central-difference scheme
does not.

        assembled operators rather than declared.

        The deck used to say this and had no freedom in what to say: an inertia is what a
        central-difference update divides by, so a field carrying one is second order and a field
        carrying none is not. Deriving it also closes a hole the declaration had -- a field named
        in neither list was silently never integrated at all.

        Per FIELD, not per degree of freedom: a multi-material mesh can give a micro-inertia to one
        material and not to another, so covering only some of the elements carrying a field is easy
        to do by accident, and integrating part of a field as a wave equation and the rest as a
        diffusion one is not a scheme anybody chose. Such a field is refused rather than split.

        inertia
            The assembled lumped inertia, before the first-order entries are overwritten with

            inertia has to still be there, or its field would look unintegrable.
        damping
            The assembled lumped damping, likewise.

        ValueError

        Refinement interpolates the velocity onto new nodes and re-lumps every per-element
        scalar property, and the three invariants behave differently under that:

        * **Every field's own lumped total is conserved exactly**, by the same geometric
          identity regardless of what that field's coefficient physically is: the children of a
          refined element tile it and carry the same value. Checked per FIELD, not per family,
          via :meth:`_checkLumpedQuantityConserved` -- summing across fields first, even ones
          that agree on units, would let a violation in a numerically small field hide inside a
          numerically large one. Violating any single field's total raises.
        * **Linear momentum is conserved exactly for a spatially uniform velocity field**, because
          the shape functions are a partition of unity and the child masses sum to the parent's. For
          a general field the discrepancy is second order in the velocity gradient across the parent:
          discretisation error, not a defect. Reported, not enforced. Restricted to the fields whose
          inertia is a mass, per :func:`~edelweissfe.config.phenomena.carriesLinearMomentum`: a
          viscosity or a non-mechanical inertia has no associated momentum, and a rotational inertia
          has an angular one that must not be added to a linear one. Across those fields the sum IS
          legitimate, because a real total system momentum is exactly the sum of its parts' momenta.
        * **Kinetic energy is not conserved** by interpolation plus re-lumping, and it is the most
          sensitive of the three, being quadratic in the interpolation error. Reported as a relative
          jump; more than roughly a percent is a reason to look at the transfer rather than to
          believe the physics. Restricted to the fields whose 0.5*m*v**2 is an energy -- the
          mass-carrying ones and the rotational ones, a wider set than momentum admits -- and
          reason, and summed across them for the same reason momentum is.

        lumpedTotalsBefore
            Every first- and second-order field's own lumped total before the change, by field
