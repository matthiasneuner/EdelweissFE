"""The nonlinear implicit dynamic solver: Newmark-beta time integration on top of the Newton loop
of :class:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitstatic.NIST`.

An increment solves the semi-discrete equation of motion

.. math::

    \\boldsymbol{M} \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} + \\boldsymbol{C} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1}
    + \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{int}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{n+1}) = \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{ext}(t_{n+1})

for the displacement at the end of the increment, with the velocity and the acceleration expressed
through the displacement increment :math:`\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{u}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{u}_n`
by the two Newmark relations (Newmark 1959; Hughes, *The Finite Element Method*, ch. 9)

.. math::

    \\boldsymbol{u}_{n+1} &= \\boldsymbol{u}_n + \\Delta t \\, \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n
        + \\tfrac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\left[ (1 - 2\\beta) \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n
        + 2\\beta \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} \\right], \\\\
    \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} &= \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n
        + \\Delta t \\left[ (1 - \\gamma) \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n + \\gamma \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} \\right].

Solved for the end-of-increment kinematics these read

.. math::

    \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} &= \\frac{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u} - \\Delta t \\, \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n
        - \\Delta t^2 \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\beta \\right) \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n}{\\beta \\, \\Delta t^2}, \\\\
    \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} &= \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n
        + \\Delta t \\left[ (1 - \\gamma) \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_n + \\gamma \\, \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} \\right],

so that the effective residual and tangent handed to the Newton loop are

.. math::

    \\boldsymbol{R} &= \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{ext} - \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{int}
        - \\boldsymbol{M} \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{C} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{n+1}, \\\\
    \\boldsymbol{K}_\\mathrm{eff} &= \\boldsymbol{K} + \\frac{1}{\\beta \\, \\Delta t^2} \\boldsymbol{M}
        + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta \\, \\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{C}.

Everything else -- element evaluation, loads, constraints, multi-point-constraint condensation,
Dirichlet handling, the convergence test, cutbacks and the linear solver -- is the parent's: this
solver runs :meth:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitstatic.NIST.solveIncrement` itself and
enters it only through its three hooks -- :meth:`NonlinearImplicitDynamic.initializeIncrement`
(mass, damping, dynamic stiffness, initial acceleration), :meth:`NonlinearImplicitDynamic.assembleAdditionalTerms`
(two terms in the residual and two in the tangent, where the parent forms ``R = P_ext - P_int``
and before the tangent is converted to CSR) and :meth:`NonlinearImplicitDynamic.finalizeIncrement`
(the converged velocity and acceleration become the state).

**Parameters.** The default :math:`\\beta = 1/4`, :math:`\\gamma = 1/2` is the average-acceleration
(trapezoidal) rule: second-order accurate, unconditionally stable for linear problems and free of
numerical damping, so the discrete energy of an undamped linear system is conserved exactly and
any drift in it points at a bug rather than at the scheme. :math:`\\gamma > 1/2` adds algorithmic
damping at the price of first-order accuracy; :math:`\\gamma \\geq 1/2` together with
:math:`\\beta \\geq (\\gamma + 1/2)^2 / 4` keeps the scheme unconditionally stable. A choice outside
that region is accepted with a warning, :math:`\\beta = 0` (the explicit central-difference member
of the family) is refused, because the formulation above divides by it.

**Mass.** The mass is the CONSISTENT one, :math:`\\int_\\Omega \\rho N^T N \\, dV`, assembled from
:meth:`~edelweissfe.elements.base.baseelement.BaseElement.computeConsistentInertia` into the very
sparsity pattern the stiffness uses -- both are scattered through the same VIJ layout of the
:class:`~edelweissfe.numerics.dofmanager.DofManager`, so adding :math:`\\boldsymbol{M}/(\\beta \\Delta t^2)`
to the tangent is an entry-wise addition of two value vectors, before the parent's in-place CSR
update, its multi-point-constraint condensation and its Dirichlet row replacement, all of which
therefore act on the effective matrix without knowing it is one. The damping :math:`\\boldsymbol{C}`
is the diagonal each element reports through ``computeLumpedDamping``, placed on the diagonal of
the same layout. Both are assembled when the equation system is (re)built -- at a step's start and
after a topology change -- not per Newton iteration. A rebuild caused only by a constraint changing
its connectivity (a contact candidate list, which can change on every increment) leaves every
element, and with it every element's slot in the layout, where it was: the operators are then
reused in the new layout rather than reassembled -- see
:meth:`NonlinearImplicitDynamic._reuseMassAndDamping`. The one exception is a step that changes a
material property mid-step (``>>changematerialproperty``), which invalidates the density and makes
them reassemble every increment.

**Which fields.** Only the fields whose inertia is a mass
(:func:`~edelweissfe.config.phenomena.carriesLinearMomentum`, i.e. the displacement) are integrated
in time. Rows and columns of the mass and the damping belonging to any other field are zeroed, and
those fields keep the parent's quasi-static treatment. A nonzero inertia an element reports there --
a rotational inertia, or the micro-inertia of a gradient-enhanced element -- is discarded with a
warning, once per field. A model with no such field is refused.

**Zero-length and negligible increments.** The time stepper yields a zero-length increment before
the first real one of every step. A quasi-static solver equilibrates it; this solver skips it with
the state kept, because in zero time nothing can move: displacement and velocity are continuous,
and a load appearing at that instant is answered by the acceleration below, not by a displacement.
Solving it statically would put a suddenly loaded model at its static deflection before the first
real increment -- the whole dynamic response skipped. An increment shorter than :math:`10^{-10}` of
the time elapsed in the step is skipped for the same reason: it is the round-off remainder the
stepper's progress accumulation leaves at the end of a step (400 increments of 0.0025 leave 2e-14),
and the Newmark update would divide by its square.

**Initial acceleration.** At the start of a step the acceleration is computed from equilibrium,
:math:`\\boldsymbol{M} \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_0 = \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{ext}(t_0) - \\boldsymbol{P}_\\mathrm{int}(\\boldsymbol{u}_0)
- \\boldsymbol{C} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}_0`, with the loads evaluated at the step's own start (an
``f(t)`` amplitude at :math:`t = 0`). Without it, a load applied suddenly at the start of a step
would enter the trapezoidal rule as though it were zero at :math:`t_0`, which costs one first-order
error in the momentum, and the scheme's second order is lost. A resumed run skips this: the
checkpoint carries the acceleration, and recomputing it would replace a consistent state with one
that agrees only to solver tolerance. Switch it off with ``computeInitialAcceleration=False`` to
continue a step from whatever acceleration was carried over.

**State and restart.** Velocity and acceleration are ordinary node-field entries, ``V`` and ``A``,
written after every converged increment alongside the parent's ``U``/``P``/``dU`` -- the same
mechanism the explicit solver uses for its velocity. That makes them part of every checkpoint the
``*output, type=restart`` manager writes and of every ``*fieldOutput`` (``result=V``,
``result=A``), with no solver-specific restart code beyond a marker that tells a resumed run not to
recompute the initial acceleration.

**Live h-adaptivity.** A ``*modelModifier, type=hAdaptivity`` refining the mesh mid-step is
supported. Three things make that work, and only the third is this solver's own:

* Being node-field entries, ``V`` and ``A`` are carried onto the nodes a refinement creates by the
  same isoparametric interpolation from the parent element that already carries ``U``
  (:data:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.adaptivity.hadaptivity.WARM_STARTED_NODE_FIELD_ENTRIES`).
  Nothing here interpolates anything itself.
* The mass and the damping are not transferred at all: they are reassembled from the elements that
  now exist, because the parent rebuilds its
  :class:`~edelweissfe.numerics.dofmanager.DofManager` on a topology change and everything bound to
  it is rebuilt with it. There is therefore no re-lumping error of the kind an explicit solver has
  to account for -- the total mass is an assembly of the new mesh, not a redistribution of the old.
* The interpolated acceleration is only as good as an interpolation of the *previous* mesh's
  acceleration, and it is not in equilibrium with the operators that were just reassembled. So the
  increment after a topology change **recomputes the acceleration from equilibrium**, with the
  cold-start machinery a step start already uses (``computeInitialAcceleration``, which also
  switches this off). The displacement and the velocity are kept: they are the kinematic state, and
  interpolation is the best statement of them the new mesh admits. Only a change that the topology
  pipeline actually recorded re-arms it -- a mere change of a constraint's connectivity (a contact
  candidate list) rebuilds the equation system without moving a node, and must not restart the
  acceleration of every degree of freedom in the model.

What is exactly conserved across a refinement, and what is not, is reported at every event and
follows from the same partition-of-unity argument the explicit solver's own live-adaptivity notes
make: the assembled total mass is a geometric identity (children tile their parent at the same
density) and is *asserted*; the linear momentum and the kinetic energy are exact for a spatially
uniform velocity field and differ at second order in the velocity gradient across a refined parent
otherwise, which is discretisation error rather than a defect, and are reported only. Unlike an
explicit run, the increment that follows re-establishes equilibrium by Newton iteration, so an
imbalance the transfer leaves behind is absorbed rather than radiated.

**Prescribed motion.** On a degree of freedom with a Dirichlet condition the acceleration is the
one the Newmark relations imply for the prescribed displacement history, starting from zero at the
step's start. For a prescribed displacement that is not smooth in time -- a velocity ramp switched
on suddenly -- the average-acceleration rule answers with an acceleration that oscillates from
increment to increment on those degrees of freedom, and the consistent mass, having off-diagonal
entries, passes the corresponding inertia forces on to the free neighbours. A smooth amplitude, or
some algorithmic damping (``newmarkGamma > 1/2``), keeps that out of the response.

**Not supported in this version.** Rayleigh or any other damping model beyond what the elements
report as their lumped damping; elements without a consistent mass (the pure-Python element
library), which are refused at the first increment.

        of a step and whenever the topology or a constraint's connectivity changes; the operators
        are bound to that manager by identity and follow it. The velocity and acceleration are then
        read back from the node fields, where the last converged increment (or the checkpoint, or
        nothing -- a start from rest) left them, and where a refinement has meanwhile interpolated
        them onto the nodes it created. A step changing a material property mid-step invalidates the
        density, so the operators are reassembled every increment of such a step.

        A rebuild that follows a recorded **topology change** additionally re-arms the
        initial-acceleration solve and reports what the change did to the conserved quantities --
        see the module docstring. Two conditions narrow that, and both matter:

        * ``system is not None``: the first build of a step is not it. A step boundary rebuilds the

          (its own ``computeInitialAcceleration``/restart logic) -- re-deciding it here would
          override that decision with a different one, for every existing multi-step deck.
        * a grown ``model.topologyHistory``: a rebuild triggered by a constraint re-reporting its
          connectivity (a contact candidate list, which can tick on any increment) has moved no
          node and interpolated nothing, so there is no stale acceleration to replace and no
          conservation statement to make. Restarting the acceleration of the whole model on it

        unchanged and the VIJ value vectors only need their element part copied into a vector of the
