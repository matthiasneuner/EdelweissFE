        ``maxNumInc`` counts increments from the start of the analysis, not from the resume, and it
        is deliberately taken from the step's own configuration rather than the checkpoint -- see
        the subclasses' ``writeRestart`` -- precisely so it can be raised between runs. The
        consequence is a trap: resume without raising it far enough and the stepper's very first
        check ends the step, the solver catches that as a step which finished normally, and the job
        exits reporting success having advanced nothing. That is indistinguishable from a completed
        run, and it has been mistaken for one: a diagnostic arm resumed at increment 130 000 with
        maxNumInc still at 60 000 ran a single zero increment, reported success, and was very
        nearly read as evidence that a crash did not reproduce.

        Only meaningful for a stepper driven by an externally imposed increment rather than by its own
        adaptation. The caller is an explicit solver whose stable time increment is a property of the
        mesh, so it changes when the mesh does -- an h-adaptivity event mid-step can shrink the
        smallest element and therefore the increment every subsequent increment must use. The
        increment is passed to :meth:`generateTimeStep` once, before the first increment, so there
        would otherwise be no way to revise it.
