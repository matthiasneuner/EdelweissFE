"""A time stepper divides a simulation step into increments. It is a small state machine:

.. code-block:: text

    while not stepper.isFinished():
        timeStep = stepper.proposeTimeStep()      # the next increment; changes nothing
        try:
            solve the increment
        except failed:
            stepper.rejectTimeStep(cutbackFactor) # a smaller increment is proposed next
            continue
        stepper.acceptTimeStep(timeStep)          # the step advances by this increment
        write output (and restart checkpoints)

All the stepper knows is in its attributes, and after :meth:`acceptTimeStep` they describe exactly
the state the next increment starts from. A restart checkpoint is written after an increment is
accepted, so it holds those attributes as they are, see :attr:`checkpointedState`.
