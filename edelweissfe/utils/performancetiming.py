    Under free-threading (PYTHON_GIL=0), :class:`~edelweissfe.solvers.base.parallelelementcomputation`
    genuinely runs Python bytecode from multiple OS threads concurrently (a real thread pool, not just
    native OpenMP workers that never touch Python state) -- and any of those worker threads may enter a
    ``timeit``-decorated/wrapped call. A single *shared* "current stack position" pointer and shared
    per-category accumulator nodes (the previous design) is not just unprotected, it is not a
    thread-safe design at all: two threads swapping the same shared pointer in ``__enter__``/``__exit__``
    can each observe the other's write, corrupting *which* node the surrounding stack frame resumes at,
    and two threads calling ``tic()``/``toc()`` on the very same shared node race on ``self._tic``,
    whichever calls second overwriting the first's start time before its own ``toc()`` reads it back --
    this is what produced the wildly inflated per-category ``acc. runtime`` figures (a "GMRES: 340s"
    reading on a run whose total wall-clock was 80s) recorded as a known gotcha before this fix.

    The correct fix is not a lock around the existing shared state (that would only serialize what is
    supposed to be genuinely parallel element computation) -- it is to give each thread its own,
    entirely independent tree, so no thread ever observes another thread's mutation of ``_tic``/``.time``
    /the stack pointer. Trees are only ever combined by :func:`_mergedSnapshot`, which reads (not
    mutates) each thread's already-accumulated snapshot -- safe because a thread's own tree is only
    ever mutated by that same thread.

    Parameters
    ----------
    category
        The category for storing the measured time.

    Thread-safety note (found on review): the *decorator* form (``@timeit(...)``) constructs exactly
    one ``timeit`` instance at decoration time, and every call to the decorated function reuses the
    same ``wrapper`` closure over that one instance -- so anything stored on ``self`` here would be
    shared and racy across concurrent or recursive calls to the same decorated function, exactly the
    class of bug this module's thread-local redesign exists to eliminate. ``wrapper`` therefore keeps
    its "what do I restore the stack to" bookkeeping in a plain local variable, not on ``self`` --
    safe by construction, since every call gets its own Python stack frame regardless of which thread
    or how many concurrent/recursive calls are in flight. The *context-manager* form (``with
    timeit(...):``) cannot do the same (``__enter__``/``__exit__`` are separate calls needing to share
    state across them) -- every call site in this codebase already constructs a fresh instance per
    ``with`` block, which is enough in practice, but ``self._parentStackLevel`` is kept in a
    per-instance ``threading.local()`` regardless, so even a ``with`` block built from a *shared,
    reused* ``timeit`` instance stays correct if used across multiple threads.
