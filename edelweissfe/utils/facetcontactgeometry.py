"""
Exact gap function, gradient, and full Hessian (including the second-derivative term arising
from the cross-product-then-normalize/rotate-then-normalize construction of the facet normal) for
a slave point against a flat contact facet (Tria3 in 3D, Line2 in 2D), expressed directly in terms
of the current nodal coordinates.

Both facets are exactly flat (a plane through 3 points, or a line through 2 points), so the
curvature/second-fundamental-form contribution present in curved-surface contact vanishes
identically -- the only surviving second-derivative term is a pose-dependent nonlinearity of the
normal's own construction from its defining nodes' positions, not a curvature effect.

The closed forms below were derived by hand and cross-verified against exact symbolic
differentiation (SymPy) at many random, non-degenerate configurations before being transcribed
here -- see the derivation/verification scripts referenced in the class docstring of
:mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty` for the underlying methodology.
Do not hand-edit these formulas without re-verifying them the same way; this kind of
normalize/rotate second-derivative algebra is very easy to get subtly wrong.

    """For each query point, the facets that could possibly be its closest one.

    Replaces an exhaustive slave x facet sweep with a spatial query, WITHOUT changing which facet
    is selected. The exhaustive form called the clamped closest-point routine once per
    slave-facet pair -- 778,000 calls on the anchor pry-out model, measured at 5.98 s per
    connectivity update, which is why the solver had to be told to search only every few hundred
    increments.

    The bound that makes this exact: let ``F*`` be the truly closest facet, at point-to-closed-
    domain distance ``d*``, with centroid ``C*`` and radius ``r*`` (its largest centroid-to-vertex
    distance). A triangle's centroid lies inside its own closed domain, so the distance to the
    facet owning the nearest centroid is at most ``d0``, the distance to that centroid -- hence
    ``d* <= d0``. And ``|x - C*| <= d* + r* <= d0 + rMax``. So every facet that could win, or
    even tie, has its centroid inside a ball of radius ``d0 + rMax``, and querying that ball
    cannot miss it.

    Candidates are returned in ascending facet index, so the caller's "first strict minimum"
    selection picks exactly the facet the exhaustive sweep would have. The result is bit-identical,
    not merely equivalent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    queryPoints
        Current coordinates of the points to be projected, shape ``(nPoints, nDim)``. Slave nodes
        for the node-based formulation, quadrature points for the integrated one.
    facetCoords
        Current coordinates of each facet's nodes.
    searchDistance
        The caller's cut-off, if any. A facet beyond it is rejected anyway, so the query radius
        is capped accordingly.
