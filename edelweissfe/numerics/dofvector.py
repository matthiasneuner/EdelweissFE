    Represents a Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) vector with entity-aware indexing.

    A `DofVector` is a 1D NumPy array subclass augmented with metadata mapping simulation
    entities (such as elements, constraints, or node sets) to their respective DOF indices.
    This enables direct indexing and assignment using entity objects as keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nDof : int
        The total number of degrees of freedom (length of the vector).
    entitiesInDofVector : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping entities (or entity keys) to their index arrays or slices
