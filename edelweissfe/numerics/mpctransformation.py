Master-slave condensation (Abaqus-style DOF elimination) of linear multi-point constraints

.. math::
    u_s = \\sum_a N_a \\, u_{m_a}

expressed as a full-size square transformation, so the equation system keeps its size ``nDof`` and
every consumer of the DOF vector layout (Dirichlet indices, convergence checks, node-field
write-back, field outputs) remains untouched.

With the transformation matrix :math:`T` (identity on independent DOFs, row :math:`s` carrying the
weights :math:`N_a` in the master columns, slave columns entirely zero) and the constraint-row
matrix :math:`C` (rows :math:`s` only: :math:`C_{ss} = 1`, :math:`C_{s m_a} = -N_a`), the
condensed implicit system reads

.. math::
    (T^T K \\, T + C) \\; \\delta U = T^T R,

where the slave rows of :math:`T^T K T` are structurally zero and :math:`C` re-inserts the
constraint equations, so the solution satisfies
:math:`\\delta U_s = \\sum_a N_a \\, \\delta U_{m_a}` exactly. The row replacement breaks symmetry
in exactly the same benign way the existing Dirichlet row treatment does.

For explicit dynamics with a lumped (diagonal) mass vector, the consistent row-sum lumping of
:math:`T^T M T` stays diagonal: each master receives its own mass plus the :math:`N_a`-weighted
mass of the slaves glued to it (total mass is conserved when :math:`\\sum_a N_a = 1`, which holds
for interpolation-type constraints). Forces are folded as :math:`\\tilde{P} = T^T P`, and the slave
kinematics are assigned directly from the masters, adding zero stiffness and hence leaving the
critical time step untouched.

        :class:`~edelweissfe.constraints.base.multipointconstraintbase.MultiPointConstraintBase`

    nDof
        The total size of the equation system.

        Compute ``transformSystemMatrix`` as the direct ``Tᵀ K T + C`` expression, but via AMGCL's
        own OpenMP-threaded ``product()``/``sum()`` instead of SciPy's single-threaded CSR sparse
        routines -- SciPy's sparse module carries no OpenMP parallelism at all, the same gap this
        codebase also closes for its outer GMRES matvec and AMG relaxation kernels elsewhere.
        Offline-measured on a reference 280k-dof model: **~2.4–2.6x faster** than the direct
        expression (``~1.4–1.5 s/call`` vs ``~2.4–2.7 s/call``), correctness-verified to
        floating-point precision.

        AMGCL's ``product()``/``sum()`` do not eliminate exact-cancellation zeros the way SciPy's
        own sparse routines do -- confirmed directly that the extra entries are >99.9999% bit-exact
        zero (20,102,955 of 20,102,975 on the reference model, the rest floating-point noise at
        ~1e-19 relative scale), so this method leaves noticeably more raw nnz (~1.6x) than the plain
        expression. **Not** pruned here: :meth:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitstatic.NIST.
        applyDirichletK` already calls ``eliminate_zeros()`` immediately after this, gated by the
        existing ``pruneCondensedMatrixZeros`` option (default ``True``, uniformly for both
        expressions) -- that gate exists precisely because PARDISO's reordering on these
        path-dependent condensed systems is known to drift with unpruned explicit-zero structural
        entries, and because ``blockamg``'s hierarchy-reuse gates on raw ``nnz``. Pruning here too
        would double that cost under the default config; setting ``pruneCondensedMatrixZeros=False``
        together with this option carries the same, now-larger, unpruned pattern into the solve,
        same as it already does for the plain expression -- verify the load path if combining the
        two. Default ``False`` pending a live gate (offline validation only so far).
