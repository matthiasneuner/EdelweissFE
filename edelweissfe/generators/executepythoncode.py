"""
Directly execute Python code to create the model tree.

The datalines are joined line by line and executed as Python source, with the model tree bound
to the name ``model``.

Leading whitespace of datalines is not preserved by the input file parser, so indented blocks
(loops, conditionals, function bodies) cannot be written with plain spaces or tabs. Instead,
indent with the literal two-character sequence ``\\t``: every occurrence is replaced by a tab
character before the code is executed, so ``\\t\\t`` indents a line by two levels.

.. code-block:: edelweiss
    :caption: Indented Python code in a generator. Example:

    *modelGenerator, generator=executePythonCode, name=gen-2
    from edelweissfe.sets.nodeset import NodeSet
    load_nodes = []
    for n in model.nodes.values():
    \\tif abs( n.coordinates[0] - 495 ) <= 20:
    \\t\\tif abs( n.coordinates[1] - 81 ) <= 1e-12:
    \\t\\t\\tload_nodes.append(n)
    model.nodeSets['load'] = NodeSet('load', load_nodes)

Note that ``\\t`` is replaced everywhere in the code, including inside string literals.

The code may read any element of the model, so the elements of the mesh described so far are made
(:meth:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.createElementsOfMesh`) -- all of them -- before it runs.
