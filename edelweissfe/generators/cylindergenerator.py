"""
A structured hex mesh generator for cylindrical geometries.

The cylinder is extruded along one of the global coordinate axes, selected
with ``axis`` (``x``, ``y`` or ``z``; ``y`` by default). The cross section
(perpendicular to that axis) is meshed as an O-grid: a square core block in
the center, surrounded by ``nR`` concentric rings of quads that map the
square's boundary radially outward onto the circle. This avoids triangles
and a singular node on the axis, so the resulting quad mesh can be extruded
into a fully hexahedral mesh. The core block's own subdivision is chosen
automatically so its elements are similarly sized to the ring elements:

.. code-block:: console

nSets, elSets, surface: 'name'_top, _bottom, _outer, _all are automatically
generated. _top/_bottom refer to the two end faces (perpendicular to
``axis``), _outer to the lateral (mantle) surface at r=radius.

Additional nSets: 'name'_centerTop/_centerBottom, the single node on the
cylinder's axis at each end face; and, for the two global axes spanning the
cross section, 'name'_centerLine<A>Top/_centerLine<A>Bottom, the nodes on
the diametral line parallel to axis <A> passing through the cylinder's axis,
on the top and bottom end faces only. <A> is spelled in upper case, so the
default ``axis=y`` yields _centerLineXTop/_centerLineXBottom and
_centerLineZTop/_centerLineZBottom.

Example
-------

Generate meshes on the fly using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: edelweiss

    *job, name=job, domain=3d, solver=NIST

    *modelGenerator, generator=cylinderGenerator, name=gen
        radius  =5.0
        lY      =10.0
        nR      =4
        nY      =8
        elType  =C3D8

Extruding along another axis only takes ``axis``; ``lY`` and ``nY`` keep
their names but are then measured along that axis, and ``x0``/``y0``/``z0``
still give the center of the bottom face:

.. code-block:: edelweiss

    *modelGenerator, generator=cylinderGenerator, name=gen
        axis    =z
        z0      =-10.0
        radius  =5.0
        lY      =10.0
        nR      =4
        nY      =8
        elType  =C3D8
