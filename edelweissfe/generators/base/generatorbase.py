    A structured generator lays out a full grid of node positions, of which only some become nodes
    of the model (the others carry the label :data:`GRID_POSITION_WITHOUT_NODE`), and only some of
    those belong to an element. Its node sets keep exactly the nodes of its elements -- the nodes that
    carry fields -- which this mask selects without any element object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodeGrid
        The grid of :class:`~edelweissfe.points.node.Node` objects.
    elementNodeLabels
        The node labels of every element the generator described.

class GeneratorBase(OptionSchemaProvider, ABC):
    """Base class for model generators.

    Unlike sections/constraints/output managers, a generator has no further interface beyond its
    constructor: populating (or otherwise mutating) ``model`` *is* what a generator does, and it
    does so directly in ``__init__`` -- there is no separate ``apply``/``solve`` method every
    generator must also implement.

    A generator is reached either from Python or from an ``.inp`` file, and the input file is a
    *serialization* of the Python path, not a second way of building the model contribution. Each
    generator declares a real typed ``__init__`` and an option :attr:`schema`; the default
    :meth:`fromGeneratorDefinition` below is the only translation the ``.inp`` front-end needs, for
    the common case (a flat set of scalar options, no structural name to resolve against the model
    -- a generator *creates* sets/elements, it does not reference existing ones by name). Override
    :meth:`fromGeneratorDefinition` for a generator whose datalines are not a flat option mapping
    (e.g. ``executePythonCode``'s raw code lines).

        This is the one place a generator's input-file shape (string-typed datalines) is turned
        into the typed arguments its real constructor takes. The default implementation covers
        every generator whose datalines are a flat ``key=value`` option mapping, which is every
        one built into EdelweissFE except ``executePythonCode``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of this generator instance (from the ``*modelGenerator`` keyword's own
            required ``name`` argument), used by every built-in generator as the prefix for the
            node/element sets it creates.
        model
            The model tree to populate. Mutated in place.
        journal
            The journal object for logging.
        args
            The generator's positional (non-``key=value``) dataline tokens. Ignored by every
            built-in generator except ``executePythonCode``, which overrides this method to use
            them instead of ``kwargs``.
        kwargs
            The generator's ``key=value`` dataline options.

        Returns
        -------
        FEModel
            The (mutated) model tree.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

            translate ``kwargs`` into a typed constructor call without one.
