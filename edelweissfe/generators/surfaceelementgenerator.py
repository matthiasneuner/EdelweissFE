Generates flat, geometry-only "contact facet" elements (:class:`~edelweissfe.elements.
contactsurfaceelement.Tria3ContactFacet` / ``Line2ContactFacet``) from an existing ``*surface``
definition, for use as the slave or master side of node-to-deformable-surface penalty contact.
Quad faces of 3D solids are split into two Tria3 facets via a fixed diagonal. Higher-order
element faces are either reduced to their linear corner-node subset (``triangulation=corner``,
exact for straight-edged meshes) or triangulated including their midside nodes
(``triangulation=midside``, strictly more accurate for curved faces). The facets carry
face-consistent per-node tributary area shares for the pressure-weighted contact formulation;
``nodalWeights`` selects between the facet tiling's own consistent shares and the non-negative
weighting that best approximates a *serendipity* face's consistent nodal loads. See the
:doc:`contact theory documentation </documentation/contacttheory>` for the full background.

The underlying :func:`buildContactFacets` is idempotent and re-runnable, so a
:class:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.MeshDependent` consumer of these facets (e.g.
:mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty`) can regenerate them from the
current ``*surface`` definition after the source solid elements change underneath it (e.g. an AMR
refinement) as well as at setup time; the recipe is recorded in ``model.contactFacetRecipes``.

    ``Ntilde_corner = 0`` of Puso, Laursen & Solberg (CMAME 197, 2008).

    Why this particular weighting: for a quad8 face of area :math:`A` the consistent nodal loads of
    a uniform pressure are :math:`-pA/12` per corner and :math:`+pA/3` per midside node. A
    unilateral per-node penalty spring cannot carry the negative corner load -- a negative
    tributary area would turn that spring into an attractor -- so no admissible weighting is exact,
    and the mismatch against the consistent loads is a self-equilibrated, zero-moment corner/
    midside alternating load pattern that excites the face's quadratic surface modes (visible as
    surface undulation under contact, and not reduced by mesh refinement: it is a fixed fraction of
    the transmitted traction).

    Among all resultant-exact, non-negative weightings the mismatch per node is
    :math:`w_{\text{corner}} + A/12`, monotone in the corner share, so a *vanishing* corner share
    is the optimum. That is this weighting: it reduces the mismatch from :math:`A/8` per node (the
    default ``facetConsistent`` shares of the midside triangulation) to :math:`A/12`, i.e. by a
    third, and it is provably the best a per-node weighting can do. Removing the remaining
    :math:`A/12` requires integrating a pressure *field* against the parent face's own quadratic
    shape functions (segment-to-segment/mortar), which this formulation does not do.

    Applied per facet: the midside table lists every corner triangle as ``(m_prev, c, m_next)``, so
    local index 1 is the corner and its two adjacent midside nodes on the parent face are exactly
    local indices 0 and 2. The redistribution therefore never leaves the facet, and stays correct
    for distorted and curved faces, whose four corner triangles have unequal areas.

    Side effect: the corner nodes of the affected faces end up with a zero tributary area, i.e.
    they are no longer contact points at all. This is intended (it is what removes the corner
    over-constraint), but it also means they carry no penetration guard.

    IMPORTANT, measured: no benefit has been demonstrated for this weighting. Wherever a quadratic
    face carries a near-uniform pressure, the unilateral constraint resolves the impossible tensile
    corner load by *opening the corner gaps* rather than by carrying a mis-distributed load -- in
    the matched hexa20 patch test all nine corner nodes lift off under both weightings, so their
    tributary area is already irrelevant and this reassignment changes the interface force by
    0.007% and nothing else. It can only matter where corner nodes are genuinely pressed into the
    master (convex slave corners, strongly non-matching interfaces), which no test here covers. See
    :ref:`serendipity-liftoff` in the contact theory documentation before reaching for this option.
