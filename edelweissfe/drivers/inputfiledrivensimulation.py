    Based on the keyword ``*job``, the finite element model is defined.

    It assembles
     * the information on the job
     * the model tree
     * steps
     * field outputs
     * output managers

    and controls the respective solver based on the defined simulation steps.
    For each step, the step-actions (dirichlet, nodeforces) are collected by
    external modules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputfile
        The input file in dictionary form.
    verbose
        Be verbose during the simulation.
    suppressPlots
        Suppress plots at the end of simulation for batch runs.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing
            - The final model tree
            - The fieldoutput controller containing all processed results.
