"""Refinement marking (WS-G): the markers that decide which elements an adaptivity mechanism refines.

Each marker is a small, registry-resolved policy object (see :mod:`edelweissfe.config.markerlibrary`)
implementing :meth:`MarkerBase.mark`. Topological markers select from a set/surface; the
:class:`FieldOutputMarker` thresholds a per-element quantity.

A marker reads only what every process of a domain-decomposed run holds whole: the mesh (element
numbers, node labels, sets and surfaces), the nodes and the node fields, and the results of field
outputs, which are results of the whole element set in every process. It never reads an element
object, of which a process may hold only its own; it marks element numbers. So every process marks
the same elements, and refines the same mesh. Deliberately, a marker never re-derives
a field quantity itself: the reduction (a magnitude, a principal stress via ``eigVal``, a norm, ...)
lives in the referenced fieldOutput's own ``f(x)`` -- one first-class, reusable quantity -- and the
marker only applies the refinement decision (a threshold) on top of it.

    What it adds is :meth:`elementsAtNode`, the map from a node label to the refineable elements

class RecoveryErrorMarker(MarkerBase):
    r"""Zienkiewicz-Zhu recovery-based error indicator on the *gradient* of a nodal field, with
    Doerfler bulk marking. Aimed at gradient-enhanced damage: the nonlocal driving field
    :math:`\bar\varepsilon` (governed by a screened-Poisson/Helmholtz equation) is smooth, but its
    gradient localizes in the process zone, and that is where the mesh must be resolved.

    The per-element indicator is the L2 norm of the difference between a recovered, continuous
    gradient field and the raw (discontinuous) FE gradient,

    .. math:: \eta_K = \lVert \nabla\bar\varepsilon^{*} - \nabla\bar\varepsilon^{h} \rVert_{L^2(K)},

    which is exactly the thermal-flux ZZ estimator applied to the nonlocal field (the constant
    length-scale factor :math:`\ell^2` cancels out of a pure ranking, so it is omitted). The
    recovered field :math:`\nabla\bar\varepsilon^{*}` is built by volume-weighted nodal averaging of
    the FE gradient sampled at the 2x2x2 (superconvergent) Gauss points -- the serendipity HEX20
    sweet spot. (An SPR patch-least-squares variant is a planned upgrade behind ``recovery``.)

    Selection is by Doerfler bulk marking on the squared indicators: the worst elements whose
    :math:`\sum \eta_K^2` first reaches ``markFraction`` of the total are marked -- but never more
    than ``maxRefinedFraction`` of all elements. Under a fixed single-level refinement this is the
    natural criterion: refinement depth is fixed, so marking reduces to ranking, and the hard cap
    keeps the direct-solver (PARDISO) factorization cost bounded.

    Doerfler is a purely *relative* criterion, so on its own it always marks a ``markFraction`` share
    of the ranking -- even in the elastic phase, before any damage, where the nonlocal field is
    *machine zero* (~1e-30). Crucially, a relative gate cannot fix this: the noise-level field's
    recovered-vs-FE gradient mismatch is O(1) *relative to itself*, indistinguishable from a genuinely
    localizing field. Marking is therefore gated by an **absolute** floor ``fieldThreshold`` on the
    peak nodal ``|field|`` per element -- an element is a candidate only where the driving field is
    significant (the active-damage field is 1e-5 and up, ~25 orders above the elastic noise, so the
    separation is unambiguous). Among those significant elements a secondary ZZ *global relative error*
    gate ``relTol`` skips regions the mesh already resolves well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodeFieldName
        Name of the nodal field whose recovered-gradient error drives marking (e.g.
        ``'nonlocal damage'``).
    markFraction
        Doerfler bulk fraction ``theta`` in ``(0, 1]``: mark the worst elements accumulating this
        fraction of the total squared error.
    maxRefinedFraction
        Hard cap on the fraction of eligible elements a single pass may mark.
    fieldThreshold
        Absolute floor on the peak nodal ``|field|`` per element: an element is a refinement candidate
        only where the driving field itself is significant. This is what keeps the elastic phase (where
        the nonlocal field is machine zero, ~1e-30) from being refined -- a purely relative criterion
        cannot, because the noise-level field's recovered-vs-FE gradient mismatch is O(1) relative to
        itself. Set it to a small fraction of the field value at damage initiation (for a strain-like
        driving field, damage onset is ``O(f_t / E)``, so a default of ``1e-6`` sits well below onset
        yet ~20 orders above the elastic noise). Set to ``0.0`` to disable and refine on gradient
        roughness alone.
    relTol
        Global relative-error threshold, applied among the significant elements only: while
        :math:`\lVert \eta \rVert / \lVert \nabla\bar\varepsilon^{h} \rVert < \text{relTol}` the field
        is treated as well resolved and no element is refined. Set to ``0.0`` to disable.
    halo
        Number of rings of node-adjacent elements to add around the Doerfler-marked set (a refinement
        buffer). The ZZ estimator responds to gradient error, which peaks on the *flanks* of a
        localization band and dips over its (locally smooth) core, so on its own it can refine two rows
        straddling a crack while leaving the core coarse. ``halo=1`` bridges those rows across the
        core; a larger halo also refines ahead of the propagating front. ``0`` (default) keeps the bare
        Doerfler set. The halo grows only within the refineable elements, so it never leaks elsewhere,
        and it is applied *after* the ``maxRefinedFraction`` cap, so the final count may exceed it.
    recovery
        Recovery method: ``'averaging'`` (volume-weighted nodal averaging, ZZ 1987) or ``'spr'``
        (superconvergent patch recovery, ZZ 1992 -- the sharper choice for serendipity elements).
    entry
        Node-field value entry to read (``'U'``, the current converged field, by default).
