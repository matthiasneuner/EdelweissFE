A penalty based unilateral contact constraint between a deformable slave surface and a deformable

contactsurfaceelement`, typically created via :mod:`~edelweissfe.generators.surfaceelementgenerator`).
The slave surface's nodes act as the contact points; each slave node's penalty force is weighted by
its tributary area (the sum of ``measure / nFacetNodes`` over its incident slave facets, evaluated
in the reference configuration), so ``penalty`` has the meaning of an interface stiffness modulus
per unit area, and the contact response converges under slave surface refinement.

This constraint is a :class:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.MeshDependent`: if either surface's
source solid elements are refined mid-run (e.g. by :mod:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.adaptivity.
hadaptivity`), it regenerates that side's facets from the current (refined) ``*surface`` definition
and rebinds its cached facet list/reference coordinates at its own next :meth:`updateConnectivity`
tick -- no separate wiring needed. A retained slave node (same across the rebuild, by ``Node``
identity) keeps its frictional history and augmented-Lagrange multiplier; a newly exposed one
starts at rest.

class Constraint(ConstraintBase, MeshDependent):
    """
    Penalty based unilateral contact between the tributary-area-weighted nodes of a deformable
    slave surface and a deformable master surface, both represented by flat (Tria3/Line2) contact
    facet elements.

    Theoretical background
    -----------------------
    Each facet is exactly flat (a plane through 3 nodes, or a line through 2 nodes), so its normal
    has exactly zero curvature over its own domain -- mirroring why the discrete rigid body
    contact's triangulated master surface didn't need a curvature term either. Unlike that rigid
    case, though, each facet's nodes are ordinary displacement DOFs of a deformable body, and
    different facets have disjoint DOFs -- so the set of candidate master facets must be kept in
    sync with the actual equation system rather than fixed once for the whole analysis.

    This constraint implements :meth:`updateConnectivity`, called once per increment (before the
    equation system is (re)built, see :class:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitstatic.NIST`),
    re-assigning each slave node to its single closest facet (within ``searchDistance``, if given)
    based on the last converged configuration -- mirroring the pattern already used by
    EdelweissMeshfree's ``NonlinearQuasistaticSolver``/``DiscreteRigidBodyPenaltyContact`` for
    dynamic contact-pair connectivity. Within :meth:`applyConstraint`, the gap, its exact gradient,
    and its exact Hessian (see :mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.facetcontactgeometry`, including the
    second-derivative term from the facet normal's own pose-dependence -- not curvature, since the
    facet is flat) are recomputed fresh from the *current Newton iterate* every iteration, exactly
    as :mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodiscreterigidbodypenalty` does for rigid bodies -- no
    geometry is frozen across iterations within an increment.

    Each slave is assigned at most *one* active facet at a time (reassigned each increment); this
    is a deliberate simplification relative to a multi-candidate-per-slave design -- see the
    project plan this was built from for the more elaborate alternative and why it was not needed
    here. If the slave's assigned facet ever fails its exact in-facet containment test mid-Newton
    (the true contact point has moved onto a neighboring facet within the same increment), no
    contact contribution is assembled for that slave until the next connectivity update -- the
    same accepted non-smoothness at facet boundaries as the rigid-body case's mesh edges.

    The slave side is itself a contact facet surface: the constraint's contact points are the
    unique nodes of the ``slaveSurface`` element set, and each node's penalty force is weighted by
    its tributary area (the sum of ``measure / nFacetNodes`` over its incident slave facets,
    evaluated in the reference configuration). ``penalty`` is thus an interface stiffness modulus
    per unit area, the assembled forces approximate a contact *pressure* distribution, and the
    contact response is insensitive to slave surface refinement.

    With ``sliding=small`` (Abaqus-style small sliding), the closest-point projection of each
    slave onto the master surface -- assigned facet, *clamped* local coordinates (closed-domain
    closest point: interior, edge, or vertex; no dead zone at facet seams), and unit normal -- is
    frozen once per increment from the last converged configuration. The gap is then *linear* in
    the displacement DOFs: the gradient is constant, the geometric Hessian term vanishes, and
    both non-smoothness sources of the finite-sliding formulation (facet-normal snap at seams,
    mid-Newton containment loss) disappear; only the gap-sign activation switch remains. This is
    the appropriate formulation for small-deformation applications, and the required basis for
    friction.

    Coulomb friction (``mu > 0``, requires ``sliding=small``) uses an elastic-predictor/
    radial-return corrector in the frozen tangent frame: the tangential force history (promoted
    on increment acceptance via :meth:`acceptLastState`, rotated into the new tangent plane on
    reassignment) plus the tangential penalty stiffness times the incremental relative slip forms
    the stick predictor, capped at ``mu * N`` on the friction cone. The consistent tangent is
    symmetric in stick and nonsymmetric on slip (normal-tangential coupling). Combine with
    ``type=quadratic`` (see the ``mu`` option documentation).

    With ``augmentedLagrange=True`` (requires ``sliding=small``), a per-slave normal traction
    multiplier augments the penalty force. It is constant within an increment (zero tangent
    contribution -- it cannot destabilize Newton) and is updated on increment acceptance by the
    converged *penalty force part* (incremental Uzawa; note that the textbook ``penalty * A * g``
    update is correct for the linear law only and overshoots grossly for the quadratic one),
    clamped at zero from above, released at open gaps. Penetration is driven toward zero over
    the increments at a fixed -- hence freely reducible -- penalty, and the friction cone
    ``mu * N`` uses the sharper multiplier-augmented normal force.

    Per-slave results (normal pressure, tangential traction, gap) are exposed via
    :meth:`getNormalPressures`/:meth:`getTangentialTractions`/:meth:`getGaps`, ordered like the
    ``<prefix>_nodes`` node set created by the surface element generator (both enumerate the
    unique slave nodes in facet-creation/first-seen order), so they can be requested directly as
    a ``fromExpression`` field output associated with that node set::

        *fieldOutput
        >>fromExpression, name=pN, nSet=slaveSurf_nodes,
        expression='model.constraints["contact"].getNormalPressures()'

    Currently only available for spatialdomain = 3D (Tria3 facets) or 2D (Line2 facets), matching
    whichever facet type populates the given surface element sets.
