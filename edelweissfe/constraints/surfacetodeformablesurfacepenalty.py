"""
A penalty based unilateral contact constraint between two deformable surfaces, integrated over the
slave surface at quadrature points and distributed with each side's *parent element face* shape
functions -- a Gauss-point-to-segment (GPTS) formulation.

Why this exists alongside :mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty`: a
node-based penalty scheme cannot transmit a correct pressure across a *serendipity* (quad8/hexa20)
face, and no choice of nodal weights can repair it. The consistent nodal loads of a uniform
pressure :math:`p` on a quad8 face of area :math:`A` are :math:`-pA/12` at the corners and
:math:`+pA/3` at the midsides -- the corner load is *tensile*, while a unilateral spring can only
push. The discrete solution resolves that contradiction by opening the corner gaps: on a matched
hexa20 patch test all corner nodes lift off, carrying no load, and the transmitted force falls ~1.7%
short with a visibly undulating interface. See issue #112.

Integrating instead removes the contradiction at its root. The pressure is evaluated *pointwise*
at quadrature points, where it is non-negative as physics requires, and is then distributed with
the parent face's own shape functions, so the nodal force at node :math:`a`,

.. math::
    f_a = \\sum_q w_q \\, J_q \\, p_q \\, N_a(\\xi_q) ,

is negative wherever :math:`N_a` is -- a tensile *nodal* force arising from a non-negative
*pressure field*, with no unilateral condition ever imposed at a corner node. Note that quadrature
alone would achieve nothing: the flat facets' own linear shape functions are non-negative, so
distributing with those would leave the corners lifting off exactly as before. The parent-face
basis (:mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.parentfacegeometry`) is the load-bearing half of the formulation.

Scope of this implementation: normal penalty contact under ``sliding=small``, for both the implicit
and the explicit solver path. Coulomb friction and augmented Lagrange are *not* implemented (the
node-based constraint has both); the per-quadrature-point state they need is carried here so they
can be added without restructuring. ``sliding=finite`` is rejected rather than approximated, see
:class:`Constraint`.

What this formulation does *not* fix: pointwise enforcement at quadrature points still
over-constrains a non-matching interface, and the integrand is discontinuous inside a slave facet
wherever the assigned master facet changes, so that quadrature error does not vanish under
refinement of the rule. Exactness on non-matching meshes requires segment clipping and weak
enforcement through a multiplier field -- mortar. This is the strictly weaker, strictly simpler
member of that family, and it is what the corner-liftoff defect actually calls for.

    """
    Penalty based unilateral contact between two deformable surfaces, integrated at quadrature
    points over the slave surface's facets and distributed with both sides' parent element face
    shape functions.

    Theoretical background
    -----------------------
    The contact points are *quadrature points*, not nodes. Each slave facet carries an
    ``nQuadraturePoints``-point rule; a point at facet-barycentric coordinates :math:`b` sits at
    parent-face parametric coordinates :math:`\\xi = b \\cdot \\Xi` (with :math:`\\Xi` the facet
    vertices' own parametric coordinates in the parent face, stamped by the surface element
    generator), and carries the constant weight :math:`J_q = A_{\\text{facet}}^{\\text{ref}} w_q`.
    Its position follows the *curved* parent surface, :math:`x_q = N^s(\\xi_q) \\cdot x^s`, so the
    slave-side faceting error of the node-based formulation disappears as well.

    Under ``sliding=small`` the projection is frozen once per increment: the assigned master facet,
    the parametric location of the closest point *in that facet's parent face*, and the facet's unit
    normal :math:`\\bar{n}`. The gap is then

    .. math::
        g = \\bar{n} \\cdot \\left( N^s(\\xi_q) \\cdot x^s - N^m(\\xi_m) \\cdot x^m \\right) ,

    which is *linear* in the displacement DOFs, so the gradient
    :math:`w = \\bar{n} \\otimes [N^s, -N^m]` is constant, the geometric Hessian vanishes
    identically, and the tangent :math:`\\mathrm{d}f_n/\\mathrm{d}g \\, w \\otimes w` is
    symmetric.
    Structurally this is the same algebra as the node-based constraint's frozen form, with that
    formulation's slave coefficient ``1`` replaced by the slave face's shape-function vector -- which
    is precisely the generalization that lets a corner node carry a tensile force.

    Note that the gap is measured to the *parent surface* point :math:`N^m(\\xi_m) \\cdot x^m`, not
    to the flat facet point :math:`b \\cdot x^{\\text{facet}}`. This matters: distributing the force
    with :math:`N^m` while measuring the gap to the flat point would make the force distribution
    differ from the transpose of the gap gradient, i.e. a non-symmetric, variationally inconsistent
    operator. The flat facets serve only as the search and parametrization scaffold; the contact
    geometry itself is the curved parent surface. For straight-edged faces the two points coincide
    identically, so nothing is lost in the common case.

    ``sliding=finite`` is rejected rather than approximated. It would require the exact gap gradient
    and Hessian of a point against a *curved* quadratic surface, whose closest-point projection is
    itself an iterative sub-problem -- a substantially different formulation from the flat-facet
    algebra of :mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.facetcontactgeometry`, not a variation on it.

    Like the node-based constraint, this is a
    :class:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.MeshDependent`: if either surface's source solid
    elements are refined mid-run, it rebuilds that side from the regenerated facets at its own next
    :meth:`updateConnectivity` tick. Since no frictional or multiplier history exists yet, the
    rebuild is unconditional and carries nothing across -- the point at which friction is added is
    the point at which that becomes a real problem, because quadrature points, unlike nodes, have no
    identity that survives a retiling.
