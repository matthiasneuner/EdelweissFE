"""
A penalty based unilateral contact constraint between two deformable surfaces, integrated over the
slave surface at quadrature points and distributed with each side's *parent element face* shape
functions -- a Gauss-point-to-segment (GPTS) formulation.

Why this exists alongside :mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty`: a
node-based penalty scheme cannot transmit a correct pressure across a *serendipity* (quad8/hexa20)
face, and no choice of nodal weights can repair it. The consistent nodal loads of a uniform
pressure :math:`p` on a quad8 face of area :math:`A` are :math:`-pA/12` at the corners and
:math:`+pA/3` at the midsides -- the corner load is *tensile*, while a unilateral spring can only
push. The discrete solution resolves that contradiction by opening the corner gaps: on a matched
hexa20 patch test all corner nodes lift off, carrying no load, and the transmitted force falls ~1.7%
short with a visibly undulating interface. See issue #112.

Integrating instead removes the contradiction at its root. The pressure is evaluated *pointwise*
at quadrature points, where it is non-negative as physics requires, and is then distributed with
the parent face's own shape functions, so the nodal force at node :math:`a`,

.. math::
    f_a = \\sum_q w_q \\, J_q \\, p_q \\, N_a(\\xi_q) ,

is negative wherever :math:`N_a` is -- a tensile *nodal* force arising from a non-negative
*pressure field*, with no unilateral condition ever imposed at a corner node. Note that quadrature
alone would achieve nothing: the flat facets' own linear shape functions are non-negative, so
distributing with those would leave the corners lifting off exactly as before. The parent-face
basis (:mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.parentfacegeometry`) is the load-bearing half of the formulation.

Scope of this implementation: normal penalty contact under ``sliding=small``, for both the implicit
and the explicit solver path. Coulomb friction and augmented Lagrange are *not* implemented (the
node-based constraint has both); the per-quadrature-point state they need is carried here so they
can be added without restructuring. ``sliding=finite`` is rejected rather than approximated, see
:class:`Constraint`.

What this formulation does *not* fix: pointwise enforcement at quadrature points still
over-constrains a non-matching interface, and the integrand is discontinuous inside a slave facet
wherever the assigned master facet changes, so that quadrature error does not vanish under
refinement of the rule. Exactness on non-matching meshes requires segment clipping and weak
enforcement through a multiplier field -- mortar. This is the strictly weaker, strictly simpler
member of that family, and it is what the corner-liftoff defect actually calls for.

class Constraint(ConstraintBase, MeshDependent):
    """
    Penalty based unilateral contact between two deformable surfaces, integrated at quadrature
    points over the slave surface's facets and distributed with both sides' parent element face
    shape functions.

    Theoretical background
    -----------------------
    The contact points are *quadrature points*, not nodes. Each slave facet carries an
    ``nQuadraturePoints``-point rule; a point at facet-barycentric coordinates :math:`b` sits at
    parent-face parametric coordinates :math:`\\xi = b \\cdot \\Xi` (with :math:`\\Xi` the facet
    vertices' own parametric coordinates in the parent face, stamped by the surface element
    generator), and carries the constant weight :math:`J_q = A_{\\text{facet}}^{\\text{ref}} w_q`.
    Its position follows the *curved* parent surface, :math:`x_q = N^s(\\xi_q) \\cdot x^s`, so the
    slave-side faceting error of the node-based formulation disappears as well.

    Under ``sliding=small`` the projection is frozen once per increment: the assigned master facet,
    the parametric location of the closest point *in that facet's parent face*, and the facet's unit
    normal :math:`\\bar{n}`. The gap is then

    .. math::
        g = \\bar{n} \\cdot \\left( N^s(\\xi_q) \\cdot x^s - N^m(\\xi_m) \\cdot x^m \\right) ,

    which is *linear* in the displacement DOFs, so the gradient
    :math:`w = \\bar{n} \\otimes [N^s, -N^m]` is constant, the geometric Hessian vanishes
    identically, and the tangent :math:`\\mathrm{d}f_n/\\mathrm{d}g \\, w \\otimes w` is
    symmetric.
    Structurally this is the same algebra as the node-based constraint's frozen form, with that
    formulation's slave coefficient ``1`` replaced by the slave face's shape-function vector -- which
    is precisely the generalization that lets a corner node carry a tensile force.

    Note that the gap is measured to the *parent surface* point :math:`N^m(\\xi_m) \\cdot x^m`, not
    to the flat facet point :math:`b \\cdot x^{\\text{facet}}`. This matters: distributing the force
    with :math:`N^m` while measuring the gap to the flat point would make the force distribution
    differ from the transpose of the gap gradient, i.e. a non-symmetric, variationally inconsistent
    operator. The flat facets serve only as the search and parametrization scaffold; the contact
    geometry itself is the curved parent surface. For straight-edged faces the two points coincide
    identically, so nothing is lost in the common case.

    ``sliding=finite`` is rejected rather than approximated. It would require the exact gap gradient
    and Hessian of a point against a *curved* quadratic surface, whose closest-point projection is
    itself an iterative sub-problem -- a substantially different formulation from the flat-facet
    algebra of :mod:`~edelweissfe.utils.facetcontactgeometry`, not a variation on it.

    Like the node-based constraint, this is a
    :class:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.MeshDependent`: if either surface's source solid
    elements are refined mid-run, it rebuilds that side from the regenerated facets at its own next
    :meth:`updateConnectivity` tick. Since no frictional or multiplier history exists yet, the
    rebuild is unconditional and carries nothing across -- the point at which friction is added is
    the point at which that becomes a real problem, because quadrature points, unlike nodes, have no
    identity that survives a retiling.
