class MultiPointConstraintBase(OptionSchemaProvider, ABC):
    """Base class for linear multi-point constraints (MPCs) enforced by degree-of-freedom
    elimination (master-slave condensation), Abaqus-style.

    Unlike :class:`~edelweissfe.constraints.base.constraintbase.ConstraintBase`, a multi-point
    constraint contributes nothing to the load vector or the system matrix, owns no degrees of
    freedom, and needs no VIJ block. Instead, it declares linear dependencies

    .. math::
        u_s = \\sum_a N_a \\, u_{m_a}

    between a slave degree of freedom :math:`u_s` and master degrees of freedom :math:`u_{m_a}`.
    The solver collects these records from all multi-point constraints in the model, condenses
    the slave degrees of freedom out of the equation system (implicit solvers), or folds slave
    masses/forces onto the masters and slaves the kinematics directly (explicit dynamics). See
    :class:`~edelweissfe.numerics.mpctransformation.MultiPointConstraintTransformation`.

    Multi-point constraints are defined via the ``*constraint`` keyword like ordinary constraints,
    but live in :attr:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel.multiPointConstraints` and stay outside
    the DofManager and the constraint assembly loop entirely.

    A degree of freedom may be claimed as slave by at most one multi-point constraint of a model --
    the condensation operator rejects duplicate claims. Constraints that build their slave set
    dynamically (e.g. a tie re-projecting its surface after adaptive refinement) therefore query
    :meth:`claimedSlaveNodes` on their peers to stay out of each other's way.
    """

    #: The constraint's own records, ``(slaveNode, ...)`` tuples with the slave node first. Declared
    #: here so :meth:`claimedSlaveNodes` has a meaningful default for every subclass; subclasses
    #: storing their records elsewhere override :meth:`claimedSlaveNodes` instead.
    _records: list = []

    #: Whether a slave DOF of this constraint may be left to a constraint earlier in model order that
    #: claims it too (its record is then dropped). A constraint without a stand-in for its equation --
    #: the hanging-node constraint: nothing else keeps a hanging node on the coarse face -- sets this
    #: to False, and a dropped record is then an error, not a log line.
    mayYieldSlaveToEarlierClaim: bool = True

    #: Why a domain-decomposed job using this class needs every element object in every process
    #: (replicated elements), or None if it works with distributed elements; declared once per class,
    #: with a safe default -- see :mod:`~edelweissfe.models.elementdistribution`.
