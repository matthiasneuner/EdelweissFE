"""L3 lazy registry for the input-language redesign (see ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md``, P1).

Maps ``(category, name)`` to the implementing object (a class, or occasionally a factory
function -- see the coverage notes below) that EdelweissFE's own modules or third-party packages
(EdelweissMeshfree, plugins) provide for that name.

Four properties are load-bearing; the first three are each covered by a dedicated test in
``tests/test_registry.py``:

1. **Zero eager imports.** Importing this module must not import any element, material, solver,
   or output-manager module -- it only ever imports :mod:`importlib` and
   :mod:`importlib.metadata`. Resolving a name (importing the module that actually implements it)
   happens exclusively inside :func:`lookup`, on first use of that particular ``(category,
   name)`` pair.
2. **Built-ins work with a stale editable install.** Entry points declared in a package's
   ``pyproject.toml`` only materialize in ``importlib.metadata`` after ``pip install -e .`` is
   re-run -- so a registry that relies solely on entry-point discovery would leave a fresh
   checkout of EdelweissFE itself broken until someone remembers to reinstall it. To avoid that,
   EdelweissFE's own modules are additionally listed in the static ``_BUILTINS`` table below as
   plain ``"module.path:AttrName"`` strings -- ordinary Python string literals, requiring no
   metadata regeneration whatsoever -- and entry points are layered *on top* of that table for
   third-party discovery.
3. **Thread-safe memoization.** ``lookup()`` caches the resolved object in ``_resolved`` so a
   given ``(category, name)`` is only imported once. Under free-threading (``PYTHON_GIL=0``),
   multiple threads can call ``lookup()`` for the same key concurrently; see the docstring of
   :func:`lookup` for the chosen strategy.
4. **Names are case-insensitive, deliberately, and that belongs here rather than in the input-file
   front-end.** Both ``category`` and ``name`` are casefolded on the way in (:func:`lookup`,
   :func:`register`) and stored casefolded in ``_BUILTINS``. This is not a convenience shortcut and
   should not be "corrected" to exact matching: the whole point of this registry is that an
   external package (EdelweissMeshfree, a plugin) reaches these modules *without* the ``.inp``
   parser in the loop, so if case-insensitivity lived only in the parser, the same name would
   resolve differently depending on which front-end it arrived through. It is also what 12 of the
   13 ``config/*.py`` registries this replaces already did via ``name.lower()``; the lone
   exception, ``config/solvers.py``, is case-sensitive, so solver names becoming case-insensitive
   is this registry's one behavioral change (strictly more permissive -- no existing ``.inp``
   changes meaning). See rule (c) in ``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §3, amended to say so. Casefolded keys
   widen the window for registration collisions, which is why every way of claiming a name now
   raises :class:`RegistryConflictError` instead of silently overwriting -- see that class.

Built-in coverage
------------------
The ``_BUILTINS`` table below currently covers these categories, enumerated by hand from the
corresponding ``edelweissfe`` subpackage (see the module docstring history / this branch's report
for exactly how each list was derived):

``outputmanager`` (10), ``section`` (3), ``constraint`` (12), ``stepaction`` (13),
``generator`` (10), ``analyticalfield`` (3), ``solver`` (7), ``step`` (2), ``modelmodifier`` (1),
``statetransferstrategy`` (3), ``element`` (42), ``material`` (11), ``linsolver`` (10).

``keyword`` is the eventual single source the ``.inp`` parser consults for every top-level keyword
(``element``, ``node``, ``nSet``, ``elSet``, ``surface``, ``job``, ``section``, ``material``,
``advancedmaterial``, ``fieldOutput``, ``analyticalField``, ``solver``, ``step``, ``output``,
``updateConfiguration``, ``modelGenerator``, ``constraint``, ``modelModifier``,
``configurePlots``, ``exportPlots``, ``include``), each mapped to a
:class:`edelweissfe.keywords.base.keywordbase.KeywordBase` subclass. U1 reserved the category
empty; U2a (``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM_UNIFICATION.md``, §5) populated its first slice -- the six
structural mesh/job keywords (``element``, ``elSet``, ``node``, ``nSet``, ``surface``, ``job``),
which live nowhere as ``Module``s in the legacy grammar and so have no coexistence window to
manage. U2b populates the remaining fifteen (pluggable-module and type-dispatch keywords), so the
category now covers the full printKeywords() surface of 21 top-level keywords. Registering a
keyword here does **not** wire it into the running parser -- ``inputfileparser.py`` still resolves
every keyword through ``inputlanguage.py`` until U3 swaps it over; see each ``KeywordBase``
subclass's ``fromKeywordDefinition`` stub.

``element`` and ``material`` are keyed by *element type* / *material name* and cover exactly the
``provider=edelweiss`` namespace of ``config/elementlibrary.py`` and ``config/materiallibrary.py``.
The ``provider`` axis those two modules also dispatch on is **not** part of this registry, by
decision (``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §9): ``provider`` selects a namespace rather than a variant of
one lookup, and only ``edelweiss`` addresses anything by name at all -- ``marmot`` and
``marmotsingleqpelement`` ignore the name and return a single wrapper class, ``marmotmaterial``
returns ``None``. So those branches stay an explicit table in their own module and nothing about
them is registrable.

``linsolver`` was the last category left uncovered, because ``config/linsolve.py``'s nine entries
were not uniformly "a dotted string to a plain class/callable": ``superlu``/``umfpack`` were inline
``lambda`` closures with no module-level name to point a dotted string at, and ``gmres``/``amgcl``
require constructing a wrapper object with call-site-specific options before the usable callable
exists. It is now covered by the uniform ``createSolver(opts) -> Callable[[A, b], x]`` factory
``PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md`` §9 settled on -- see the ``linsolver`` block below.

**With ``linsolver`` folded in, there is no category left under "not covered"** -- the list above is
the complete set of things EdelweissFE dispatches by name, so a call site may now assume any of them
resolves here. What is still outside the registry is *not* a category:

- The ``provider`` axis of ``config/elementlibrary.py``/``config/materiallibrary.py`` -- a namespace
  selector rather than a name lookup, see the paragraph above.
- ``config/solvers.py``'s ``solverLibrary``, ``config/outputmanagers.py``, ``config/sections.py``
  and ``config/analyticalfields.py``, which survive purely as Sphinx rendering targets and resolve
  nothing (the pre-schema ``sectionFactory``/``analyticalFieldFactory`` construction protocol was
  deleted along with the ``section``/``analyticalfield`` L1/L2 split).

    This is the seam a plugin (or a test) uses to register an object it already holds a reference

    ----------
    category

    target
        The class (or factory callable) implementing ``name``.
    schema
        The L2 option schema dataclass associated with ``target``, if any. Usually unnecessary for

    given ``(category, name)`` is imported at most once per process.

    Thread-safety: guarded by :data:`_lock` using double-checked locking -- the cache is read
    without the lock first (the common case, once warm), and only threads that observe a miss
    contend for the lock, inside which the check is repeated before doing any work. See the
    docstring on :data:`_lock` for why a full mutex was chosen over a lock-free scheme.

    Parameters
    ----------
    category
        The registry category (e.g. ``"outputmanager"``, ``"stepaction"``).
    name
        The name within that category (e.g. ``"ensight"``, ``"dirichlet"``).
