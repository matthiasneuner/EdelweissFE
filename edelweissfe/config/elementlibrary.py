EdelweissFE currently supports finite element implementations provided by the Marmot library.
In future, elements by other providers or elements directly implemented in EdelweissFE may be added here.

    """Return the class implementing element type ``elType`` for the given ``provider``.

    ``provider`` selects a namespace, not a variant of one lookup, and is dispatched via an
    explicit table rather than the registry: ``marmot`` and ``marmotsingleqpelement`` ignore
    ``elType`` entirely and return a single wrapper class that resolves the type at the Marmot
    boundary.

    The ``edelweiss`` provider is resolved through the registry (``element`` category), keyed by
    element type, which lets a third party contribute an element type through an entry point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elType
        A string identifying the requested element formulation.
    provider
        The name of the element provider to load.

    Returns
    -------
    type
        The element provider class type.

    Raises
    ------
    edelweissfe.config.registry.RegistryLookupError
        If ``provider`` is ``edelweiss`` and no element is registered under ``elType``.

#: The element number of a prototype element (see :func:`createPrototypeElement`). A prototype never
#: becomes an element of a model and is never looked up by its number, so it cannot clash with an

    of freedom, its EnSight shape.

    Element classes answer these questions per object, not per class (a Marmot element, for instance,
    learns them from Marmot when it is created), so a mesh generator or the mesh asks a prototype
    before, or without, creating any element of the model. A prototype has no nodes and carries the
    number :data:`PROTOTYPE_ELEMENT_NUMBER`; it is never added to a model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elType
        A string identifying the requested element formulation.
    provider
