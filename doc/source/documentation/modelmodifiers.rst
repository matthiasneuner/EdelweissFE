Model modifiers
===============

.. automodule:: edelweissfe.config.modelmodifiers
    :members: __doc__

Unlike constraints, step actions or output managers -- which act on a *fixed* mesh -- a model
modifier may change the mesh topology itself during an analysis: adding or removing nodes and
elements, re-partitioning element/node sets and surfaces, and reallocating the solution fields.
A modifier is declared with the ``*modelModifier`` keyword. At the start of every increment the
solver runs **all** modifiers to a fixed point via
:meth:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.update`, then lets mesh-dependent consumers catch
up, then solves; when the topology changed, the equation system (DOF manager, sparsity pattern,
solution vectors and any multi-point-constraint transformation) is rebuilt first. A modifier itself
is written as two halves -- :meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.plan`,
which decides and may read solution state, and
:meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.apply`, which carries the
decision out and may not. **See** :doc:`topologypipeline` **for the full contract, why it is split
that way, and what a new modifier must implement**; this page covers the individual modifiers.

**Topological containers have stable identity.** :class:`~edelweissfe.sets.nodeset.NodeSet`,
:class:`~edelweissfe.sets.elementset.ElementSet`, :class:`~edelweissfe.surfaces.entitybasedsurface.
EntityBasedSurface` and :class:`~edelweissfe.fields.nodefield.NodeField` are created once and
mutated in place (``replaceMembers``/``replaceData``/``resize``) by a mesh-mutating modifier --
they are never replaced with a new object under the same name. A component that simply caches one
of these, e.g. ``self._nodes = model.nodeSets["mySet"]`` in ``__init__`` and later iterates
``self._nodes``, sees any later refinement automatically: no observer, no ``MeshDependent``, no
re-fetch. This is deliberate -- it lets a student write a new constraint, step action or output
without ever thinking about AMR.

A component that additionally pre-sizes a *derived* array or object to a container's current size
(e.g. a Dirichlet BC's ``delta`` tiled to ``len(nSet)``, or a field output's result collector
pinning a snapshot element list) does need to notice a resize, since the array does not grow with
the container on its own. Two mechanisms remain, narrowed to exactly these cases:

* **Lazy version check** -- each mutable container carries a ``_version`` counter, bumped on every
  in-place mutation. A component compares its own last-seen version against the container's current
  one at its own per-increment entry point (e.g. ``StepActionBase._checkSetChanged``,
  ``ConstraintBase._checkSetChanged``) and recomputes the derived array only on a mismatch --
  see :mod:`~edelweissfe.stepactions.dirichlet`, :mod:`~edelweissfe.stepactions.nodeforces` and
  :class:`~edelweissfe.utils.fieldoutput.ElementFieldOutput` for examples. This needs no
  registration and therefore has no observer lifecycle to leak.
* **Registered mesh dependent** -- for derived *geometry* that must be regenerated before the next
  equation-system rebuild (facet-based contact and tie; see below), a component registers itself via
  :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.registerMeshDependent` and implements
  :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.MeshDependent.refresh`. Once per increment, after every
  modifier has settled, :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.refreshMeshDependents` hands it
  the *net* change since it last looked -- added/removed nodes and elements, the parent -> children
  map, the per-face child tiling, and which node/element sets or surfaces were touched (with
  ``touchesSurface``/``touchesNodeSet``/``touchesElementSet`` early-outs so a consumer can skip a
  change that doesn't concern it).

  The synchronous push notification that used to exist alongside this has been removed: with
  modifiers running to a fixed point, a per-mutation callback fires mid-pipeline and hands the
  consumer a state that no longer exists by the time the solve begins. See :doc:`topologypipeline`.

``hAdaptivity`` - Hanging-node h-adaptivity for HEX20
-----------------------------------------------------

Module ``edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.adaptivity.hadaptivity``

.. automodule:: edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.adaptivity.hadaptivity
    :members: __doc__

Dynamic adaptive :math:`h`-refinement of 20-node serendipity hexahedra (``GC3D20`` / ``GC3D20R``)
in the small-strain, multifield (displacement + nonlocal damage) regime. Each increment the
modifier evaluates one or more **markers** (see below), subdivides every marked
element into ``splitFactor**3`` children (default ``splitFactor=2``, i.e. eight octree children;
``splitFactor=3`` gives a 3x3x3 split into 27, and so on -- honouring curved edges via the parent
isoparametric map), enforces a one-level face-balance, transfers the converged nodal values (parent isoparametric
interpolation) and quadrature-point history (via a pluggable state-transfer strategy, see
``edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer``) to the children, and couples the resulting
non-conforming interface with an exact hanging-node multi-point constraint. Element/node sets, sections and element-based surfaces are propagated to
the children so material assignment and surface loads stay consistent.

A child is assigned its section exactly like an element of the initial mesh: parameters set by
``>>materialParameterFromField`` (e.g. a random strength field) are evaluated at the child's own
center. The analytical field is a function of position only, so a refined region samples the same
field realization more finely -- just as a mesh that was refined from the start would.

The octree mirror only ever tracks the refineable 20-node elements: a model that also contains
elements of a different kind (e.g. lower-order contact-facet elements bonded to the mesh) is left
untouched by construction, since anything without exactly 20 nodes is skipped automatically. To
restrict refinement explicitly (rather than relying on the node-count heuristic), or to refine only
part of a purely 20-node mesh, set ``refineElSet`` (falls back to ``elSet`` if given) to the element
set that should become the octree mirror. Marking (see below) is likewise restricted to the octree
mirror's own elements by default -- there is nothing to gain from evaluating the marking expression
on an element that can never be refined anyway, and most non-solid element types don't expose most
quadrature-point results in the first place.

The non-conforming 2:1 interface is coupled kinematically rather than by mortar: octree refinement
is non-conforming but *nested*, the QUAD8 face-trace (and 3-node quadratic edge) spaces are
invariant under the axis-aligned affine sub-maps of a uniform subdivision (of *any* factor, not only
bisection), so pinning each hanging
(slave) node to the coarse serendipity trace, :math:`u_s = \sum_a N_a(\xi_s)\, u_{m_a}`, is exact.
The same field-independent weights apply to every field on the node (equal-order serendipity), so a
single record per hanging node covers displacement and nonlocal damage alike. The constraint itself
(``*constraint, type=hangingnode``) is documented under :doc:`constraints`.

**Vocabulary.** A *root element* is an element of the mesh before refinement; every refined element
lies inside exactly one. The reference cube of a root carries an integer *reference lattice*, fine
enough that every node a subdivision can create sits on a lattice point, and every element covers an
exact *reference box* of it. A *root entity* is a vertex, edge or face of the root mesh, named by the
labels of its corner nodes. A node's *key* is the lowest-dimensional root entity containing it plus its
exact integer position there. A node *hangs* on an element if it lies on the element's boundary without
being one of its own nodes.

**Topology is decided exactly, never from coordinates.** Which nodes coincide, which node lies on which
face or edge of an element, which elements share a face (2:1 balancing), which nodes hang -- and with
which weights -- and which new nodes join a node set, are all decided topologically and in exact
integer arithmetic, the way established AMR libraries do it (deal.II, p4est, MFEM):

* every element knows its root element and its exact box in the root's reference cube (from the
  subdivision order), so every node sits at an exact lattice point of its root;
* the root mesh's vertices, edges and faces are named by the labels of their corner nodes, and a point
  on them is measured in a frame those labels fix -- two roots sharing a face therefore derive the
  identical name and coordinates for it in any relative orientation
  (:class:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.rootentities.RootEntityTable`);
* a hanging node is a node on the boundary of an active element that is not one of its own nodes; its
  master entity (edge or face) follows from its exact reference coordinates in that element, and its
  weights are the element's own shape functions there, the exact coarse trace;
* a new node joins a node set iff it lies, by its exact lattice position, on a parent face or edge
  whose nodes are all in the set.

No tolerance enters any of these decisions, so curved, warped and arbitrarily oriented unstructured
meshes (e.g. from Cubit) behave exactly like axis-aligned ones. The requirements are a *conforming* root
mesh and a refinement depth of at most 20 levels (the depth of the exact lattice). A collapsed root
element -- one that repeats a corner node, e.g. a degenerated wedge -- or a non-manifold root mesh stops
the analysis at setup with an error naming the element.

**Node sets are inherited through faces and edges.** A new node joins a node set iff it lies on a face
or edge of its parent whose nodes are *all* in the set. Two consequences follow from node membership
alone: a set that holds every node of a face -- even if it was meant as the face's perimeter only --
gains the new nodes inside that face, and a set never gains the new nodes inside a parent element. Where
a different membership is intended, define the boundary condition through an element set (or an
element-based surface) instead, which refinement propagates to the children exactly.

**2:1 balancing is face-based.** After each refinement, any element with a *face* neighbour two or more
levels finer is refined too, until every face-adjacent pair differs by at most one level. Elements that
touch only along an **edge** or at a **vertex** are *not* balanced: next to a level-0 element, an
element that shares only an edge with it may be at level 2 or deeper. Such an interface stays exactly
conforming -- the finer nodes on that edge hang on the coarsest element's edge, through constraint
chains that are resolved exactly and verified -- so this affects mesh grading and local accuracy (an
abrupt size jump along the edge), not correctness. With ``maxLevel=1`` (the default) no two-level jump
can occur at all. Edge or vertex balancing (as p4est's edge/full balance) is not implemented; it would
refine additional elements and change the results of multi-level runs.

**Invariants, checked after every adaptation.** A violation raises an error naming the offending nodes
instead of producing a silently non-conforming mesh:

* one node per point and one point per node (no split or merged nodes);
* every node on the boundary of an active element is one of its nodes or a hanging-node slave
  (:meth:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.refinement.AdaptiveMesh.check_conformity`);
* every hanging node's weights are verified in exact arithmetic: they vanish off the chosen edge or
  face and reproduce the constant, the node's reference coordinates and every quadratic monomial;
* the hanging-node constraint can never be overruled by another multi-point constraint claiming the
  same slave (it is registered first in model order; a dropped hanging-node record is an error).

**Refinement markers.** Which elements are refined each increment is decided by one or more
``>>marker`` sub-keywords; the modifier refines the *union* of their marked sets. The available
types are ``elementSet`` / ``nodeSet`` / ``surface`` (geometric, typically ``initialOnly`` for a
fixed pre-refinement), ``fieldOutput`` (a boolean threshold on a ``perElement`` field output), and
``recoveryError`` (a Zienkiewicz--Zhu recovered-gradient error estimator on a nodal field, with
Dörfler bulk marking -- for gradient-enhanced damage). The theory of error-estimator marking, the
``averaging`` vs ``spr`` recovery, and why a *reactive* ``recoveryError`` marker is best paired with
a *predictive* ``fieldOutput`` marker ahead of a propagating front are all covered under
:doc:`adaptivitytheory`.

Batching refinement across increments
--------------------------------------

Every refinement pass forces the solver to rebuild the equation system (DOF manager, sparsity
pattern, solution vectors and any multi-point-constraint transformation), which is expensive on a
large model. Left unchecked, a marker whose criterion is crossed by elements one at a time --
rather than in a single burst -- triggers that rebuild on every increment a lone element newly
qualifies. ``minMarkedElements`` (default ``1``: refine as soon as anything is marked) raises the
bar: a refinement pass happens only if one evaluation of the markers marks at least
``minMarkedElements`` eligible elements. Marks are not carried over to later evaluations -- they are
a function of the current state only, which is what keeps a restarted run identical to an
uninterrupted one. This trades refinement latency (a marked element may stay on the coarse mesh
until enough elements qualify at once) for fewer, larger equation-system rebuilds.

    :language: edelweiss
    :caption: Example (refinement deferred indefinitely because only one of the two elements ever
              crosses the marker threshold, so no evaluation reaches

State-variable transfer strategies
----------------------------------

.. automodule:: edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer
    :members: __doc__

The strategy for handing a refined parent element's quadrature-point history to its children is
selectable with the ``stateTransfer`` argument (default ``nearestQp``):

* ``nearestQp`` -- :class:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer.nearestquadraturepoint.NearestQuadraturePointCopy`:
  each child quadrature point copies, verbatim, the nearest parent quadrature point (matched in the
  parent reference cube). Admissible by construction -- the recommended default.
* ``projection`` -- :class:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer.projection.PolynomialProjection`:
  a tensor-product polynomial is fitted to the parent quadrature-point values by least squares and
  resampled at the children. Smooth across octants, but may produce an inadmissible internal state.
* ``virgin`` -- :class:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer.virgin.VirginState`: children keep
  their freshly-initialised state; history is discarded (sound only when refining ahead of the
  process zone).

Different state variables generally require different treatment, and **which** ones may be projected,
copied, or reset is entirely a property of the constitutive model -- there is no universal choice.
(For a hypoelastic model whose stress update depends only on the *strain increment*, for instance, a
stored total strain may be irrelevant while the true history variables -- stresses, back-stresses,
plastic strains, damage, hardening -- are what matter.) ``stateTransferOverrides`` therefore leaves
the policy to the user: it routes named state variables to their own strategy while the
``stateTransfer`` default handles all the rest. The names are the material's / element's own
state-variable names, located within a quadrature-point block via the element's ``getStateVarSlice``
hook and dispatched by
:class:`~edelweissfe.adaptivity.statetransfer.perstatevar.PerStateVarStateTransfer`. For example,
``stateTransfer=nearestQp`` with ``stateTransferOverrides='<var1>:projection, <var2>:virgin'`` copies
everything except ``<var1>`` (projected) and ``<var2>`` (reset to its initial value).

              only to exercise the mechanism): ``testfiles/marmot/AMR_DynamicRefinementProjection/test.inp``

Predictor after a refinement
----------------------------

On the increment in which the mesh is mutated the solver already rebuilds the equation system and
starts from a zero predictor. The *following* increment, however, extrapolates from that increment's
solution increment, which conflates the load advance with the one-off warm-start/remesh settling
transient -- a questionable predictor when refining into a softening zone. The ``NISTSolver`` option
``extrapolateAfterModelChange`` (default ``True``, i.e. previous behaviour) can be set ``False`` to
also start the increment after a refinement from a zero predictor::

    >>options, category=NISTSolver, extrapolation=linear, extrapolateAfterModelChange=False

This changes only the Newton starting guess, not the converged solution.

Re-equilibration after a refinement
-----------------------------------

By default the increment in which the mesh is refined advances the load *and* settles the
warm-started refined mesh in a single solve. Near a softening process zone -- exactly where
refinement is triggered -- coupling the load advance with the one-off warm-start settling transient
can prevent recovery. The ``NISTSolver`` option ``equilibrateAfterModelChange`` (default ``False``)
inserts, immediately after a refinement, one constant-load, zero-time re-equilibration increment
(no load advance, zero Dirichlet increment) that settles the refined mesh to equilibrium at the last
converged load *before* the load is advanced::

    >>options, category=NISTSolver, equilibrateAfterModelChange=True

On a path-independent material this is non-destructive (it changes only the increment sequence, not
the converged root); for a history-dependent material it yields a physically distinct, relaxed path,
which is the intended effect. The equilibration solve integrates materials with ``dT = 0``, so it
suits rate-independent models; rate-dependent materials see no time advance during it by design.

Refinement under a dynamic solver
---------------------------------

Both dynamic solvers refine mid-run. What makes that possible is that their kinematic state lives
in ordinary node-field entries -- ``V`` (velocity) for
:mod:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearexplicitdynamic`, ``V`` and ``A`` (acceleration) for
:mod:`~edelweissfe.solvers.nonlinearimplicitdynamic` -- so the nodes a refinement creates receive
them through the very same isoparametric warm start that already carries ``U``
(``hadaptivity.WARM_STARTED_NODE_FIELD_ENTRIES``). No solver-specific interpolation exists, and
none should: using one operator for all of them is what keeps ``U``, ``V`` and ``A`` consistent
with one another on a new node.

Three statements about a refinement, in decreasing strength, apply to both:

* the **total mass** of every dynamic field is conserved -- geometrically, since the children tile
  their parent at the same density -- and is *asserted* at every event (``NID``'s
  ``massConservationTolerance``, ``NED``'s ``lumped-quantity-conservation-tolerance``). The check
  assumes a topology change that keeps the material volume; a modifier that removes material --
  deleting elements -- would be refused by it;
* the **linear momentum** is conserved exactly for a spatially uniform velocity field, because the
  shape functions are a partition of unity; for a general field the discrepancy is second order in
  the velocity gradient across the refined parent, which is discretisation error, not a defect;
* the **kinetic energy** is not conserved in general and is the most sensitive of the three, being
  quadratic in the interpolation error. Both solvers report the relative jump at every event; more
  than roughly a percent is a reason to look at the transfer rather than to believe the physics.

The two differ in what happens *after* the transfer, and the difference is the integrator's, not
the adaptivity's. ``NED`` has no equilibrium iteration to absorb an imbalance, so it zeroes the
internal force for one increment and lets the material respond over the following ones. ``NID``
does have one -- but it also holds an acceleration, and an *interpolated* acceleration is not in
equilibrium with the mass just reassembled on the refined mesh. So ``NID`` re-solves the
acceleration from equilibrium on the increment after a topology change, with the same machinery a
step start uses; ``computeInitialAcceleration=False`` keeps the interpolated one instead. A rebuild
of the equation system that is *not* a topology change -- a contact constraint re-reporting its
connectivity -- moves no node and does not trigger it.

``NID`` ignores ``equilibrateAfterModelChange``: that option's re-equilibration increment is a
zero-time one, and in zero time a dynamic model cannot move. Its dynamic counterpart is the
acceleration re-solve above, which is always on unless switched off.

Compatibility with facet-based contact and tie
-------------------------------------------------

Refining a solid whose surface feeds a facet-based contact or :mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.tie`
constraint works out of the box: the modifier keeps the relevant ``*surface`` definition in sync
with the refined child faces, and the constraint -- a :class:`~edelweissfe.models.meshdependent.
MeshDependent` -- regenerates its facets from it. :mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.
nodetodeformablesurfacepenalty` notices via :meth:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.changesSince`
at its own next connectivity update (a pull, since that tick already runs before the equation
system is rebuilt); a tie has no such early tick of its own (its only hook is called *from inside*
that rebuild, too late to safely swap in new facet elements), so it reconciles via the model's push
notification instead. Either way, no separate wiring is needed. A model with both solid elements to
be refined and pre-existing contact-facet elements should restrict the octree mirror explicitly with
``refineElSet`` (see above), since a facet element is never itself 20-node but need not be excluded
by name::

    *modelModifier, type=hAdaptivity, name=amr
    result=stress
    expression='x > 300.0'
    reducer=absmax
    maxLevel=1
    refineElSet=lower_all

.. literalinclude:: ../../../testfiles/marmot/AMR_ContactRefinePatch/test.inp
    :language: edelweiss
    :caption: Example (the master surface's solid block is refined mid-run while contact is already
              engaged): ``testfiles/marmot/AMR_ContactRefinePatch/test.inp``

    :caption: Example (the master surface's solid block is refined mid-run while already tied):
              ``testfiles/marmot/AMR_TieRefine/test.inp``

The rigid-body contact constraints (:mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetorigidsurfacepenalty`,
:mod:`~edelweissfe.constraints.nodetodiscreterigidbodypenalty`) are likewise ``MeshDependent``, but
lighter still: their master geometry is rigid (an analytic plane, or a triangulated rigid body), so
refinement only ever grows their watched slave ``nSet`` -- no facet regeneration, no per-slave
history, just a refreshed node list at the next :meth:`updateConnectivity` tick.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../testfiles/marmot/AMR_RigidContactRefine/test.inp
    :language: edelweiss
    :caption: Example (the block is refined mid-run while its face already rests against an
              analytic rigid wall): ``testfiles/marmot/AMR_RigidContactRefine/test.inp``

Transparency for ordinary (AMR-unaware) consumers
--------------------------------------------------

A constraint, step action or output that only caches a node/element set or a surface -- e.g.
``self._nodes = model.nodeSets["mySet"]`` at construction -- needs none of the above: it sees a
later refinement automatically, because that container is mutated in place rather than replaced
(see the note at the top of this page). ``testfiles/marmot/AMR_TransparencyProbe`` is the
acceptance test for this: a minimal ``ConstraintBase`` (``edelweissfe.constraints.
amrtransparencyprobe``) that does exactly this, registers no observer and implements no
``MeshDependent``, yet raises if its cached node set is ever found not to have grown across a
refinement it should have seen -- guarding against a regression that reintroduces replacing a set
instead of mutating it.

Restart / checkpointing
------------------------

A model modifier that mutates topology, like ``hAdaptivity``, cannot rely on the plain
reconstruct-then-overwrite scheme every other checkpointed component uses (see ``*restart``): a
refined mesh's new elements and nodes aren't in the ``.inp`` file to rebuild from. Instead, the
checkpoint records only the *decisions* that drove each past change -- and the resumed run replays
them through the modifier's own
:meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.apply`, the very same
code the live run executed. The marker evaluation that produced a decision is never re-run.

**A modifier does not implement its own restart.** It implements
:meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.encodePlan` and
:meth:`~edelweissfe.modelmodifiers.base.modelmodifierbase.ModelModifierBase.decodePlan` so that its
decision survives a checkpoint; :class:`~edelweissfe.models.femodel.FEModel` records every applied
decision in :attr:`~edelweissfe.models.topologypipeline.TopologyPipeline.history` and replays it. An earlier
design had each modifier serializing its own history and implementing its own replay, which is
precisely how a resumed run came to rebuild a differently-numbered mesh -- two implementations of
one mutation always drift. See :doc:`topologypipeline`.
