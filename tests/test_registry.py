"""P1 tests (see PLAN_INPUT_SYSTEM.md) for ``edelweissfe/config/registry.py``, the L3 lazy
registry.

Covers: zero-eager-import (subprocess, since ``sys.modules`` pollution from other test modules
would otherwise make an in-process check meaningless -- the same reasoning
``tests/test_inputlanguage_golden.py`` already documents), built-in resolution without any
entry-point metadata, synthetic entry-point discovery via a directly-constructed
``importlib.metadata.EntryPoint`` (a documented, public seam -- no on-disk package install
involved), helpful lookup-failure messages, and thread-safety of the memoized lookup under
concurrent access.
