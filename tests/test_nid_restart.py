"""Restart equivalence of the Newmark-beta implicit dynamic solver (``NID``).

The same two-invocation shape as ``tests/test_restart_integration.py``: one uninterrupted
reference run, one run truncated mid-step that writes checkpoints, one run resumed from the last
checkpoint -- and the resumed run must land on the reference's final state.

What is specific to a dynamic solver, and why this test exists rather than trusting the generic
node-field checkpoint: the state of a Newmark increment is ``(U, V, A)``, not ``U`` alone. The
velocity and the acceleration are node-field entries the solver publishes after every converged
increment, so they SHOULD travel with the checkpoint through the very same mechanism as ``U`` --
but "should" is exactly what a restart test is for. Both are compared here, not only ``U``: a
resumed run that restored ``U`` and silently started ``V``/``A`` from zero would still produce a
plausible ``U`` curve. Also pinned: a resumed step must NOT recompute its initial acceleration
from equilibrium (a cold step does), because that would replace the checkpointed, scheme-consistent
acceleration by one that agrees only to solver tolerance.
