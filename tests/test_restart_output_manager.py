"""The restart writer's ring buffer continues the checkpoints already on disk instead of starting
at index 0 -- otherwise a walltime-limited job chained across several resumes would overwrite
earlier checkpoints, including, with an unchanged ``baseName``, the very one it resumed from.

Which checkpoint is oldest is read from the serial number every checkpoint carries, not from file
times: copying files changes those, and some file systems resolve them coarsely."""
