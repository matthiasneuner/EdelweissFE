"""Round-trip test for the recorded topology history of an h-adaptive model. Builds two independent
models from the same .inp via fillFEModelFromInputFile (mirroring the driver's own setup sequence,
minus solvers/steps, which this doesn't need), drives one real refinement on the first through the
live topology update, and asserts that replaying its recorded history onto the second -- freshly
rebuilt, unrefined -- reproduces the same topology.

Uses an `initialOnly` marker (edelweissfe.adaptivity.marking) so refinement triggers
deterministically on the very first topology update, regardless of field state -- which keeps the
test independent of a real solve's marker-evaluation timing.
